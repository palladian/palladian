      <title>SciFri Video:How To Lift A Beat</title>
      <link>http://www.sciencefriday.com/videos/watch/10360</link>
      <description><![CDATA[ If the term <em>sample</em> reminds you more of a cheese tasting than music making, this video is for you. DJ, music producer and clothing designer Aaron LaCrate walks us through Sampling 101--taking a snippet of a song and repurposing it in another work. LaCrate explains the process but doesn't sample in his own <a href="http://www.milkcratenyc.com/">music</a> -- to "clear" a lifted beat for use is complicated, and expensive. ]]></description>

      <title>SciFri Blog:Superstorm's sinister scheme</title>
      <link>http://www.sciencefriday.com/blog/?p=1596</link>
      <description><![CDATA[ .



"Superstorm." Sounds cool, right? Does it sound cooler than "ARkStorm Scenario as described in a contingency computer model used by the U.S. Geological Survey?" NO! ...Actually, yes. Much cooler. Regardless, some smart, experienced, and knowledgeable people were asked to describe potential scenarios for California's weather future. Some of the possibilities ain't pretty, thanks in part to our old friend global warming.

The New York Times: California faces the risk not just of devastating earthquakes but also of a catastrophic storm that could tear at the coasts, inundate the Central Valley and cause four to five times as much economic damage as a large quake, scientists and emergency planners warn.

From Yahoo News: The superstorm model projects up to 10 feet of rain overtaking California's flood protections and imposing more than $300 billion in property damage. While the model is theoretical, USGS insists it's realistic. ARkStorm Scenario combines flood mapping with climate change projections and prehistoric geologic flood history...

      <description><![CDATA[ After this last snow storm I had to go out and check our hives. Here's what they looked like.



Sadly, some bees come out, become immobilized by the cold and drop into the snow to die. With yesterday's temperature in the mid-thirties, the few bees I saw flying had not read the manual that says that bees can't fly in temperatures below 45 or 50 degrees F.  ]]></description>

      <title>SciFri Blog:But is it Food...?</title>
      <link>http://www.sciencefriday.com/blog/?p=1660</link>
      <description><![CDATA[ In the "You can't make this stuff up" department I had to chuckle while reading the article in today's Washington Post, entitled, "Is that right? The beef over Taco Bell meat." Following Beef and Water on the ingredient label supplied by the reporter is the item called Seasoning. For me this raises the question, when it comes to "food science," Just because we can, does that mean we should? Bearing in mind that Natural Flavors are "Natural" in the same way that High Fructose Corn Syrup is a "Natural Sweetener," here's that list of the meat inside these Tacos: 


Beef, Water, Seasoning [Isolated Oat Product, Salt, Chili Pepper, Onion Powder, Tomato Powder, Oats (Wheat), Soy Lecithin, Sugar, Spices, Maltodextrin, Soybean Oil (Anti-dusting Agent), Garlic Powder, Autolyzed Yeast Extract, Citric Acid, Caramel Color, Cocoa Powder (Processed With Alkali), Silicon Dioxide, Natural Flavors, Yeast, Modified Corn Starch, Natural Smoke Flavor], Salt, Sodium Phosphates. CONTAINS SOYBEAN, WHEAT

I think they missed the opportunity to claim that they're doing the consumer a favor by including a "vegetable" within the meat.... ]]></description>

      <title>SciFri Blog:Clean Air Act and React</title>
      <link>http://www.sciencefriday.com/blog/?p=1594</link>
      <description><![CDATA[ .


 

What would motivate someone to be in favor of the Clean Air Act granting the EPA regulatory powers over greenhouse gas emissions? Will those powers kill jobs and, even if they did, should reducing the impacts of climate change take precedence even over the important task of creating jobs? Let's break all this down...


	Experts are concerned climate change will cause�and has already started causing�large scale environmental problems like droughts and flooding.
	Likewise, experts are concerned climate change will cause�and is causing� territorial issues like water-rights disputes, and mass migrations.
	Another concern is the impact climate change has on health issues like disease and world hunger.
	The issues above all lead to worries about national security.
	There is increasingly convincing evidence that green technology is a major business opportunity that other countries are pursuing, while the U.S. cautiously hesitates to make a full commitment.
	There are convincing arguments�based on precedent�that government regulation can push the genius of private sector innovation into productive, profitable directions.

Despite all these factors, the new edition of the United States House of Representatives believes it's important to strip the Environmental Protection Agency of its ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. No question the country's economy is important. Even if there weren't strong evidence that actions to reduce emissions are good for the economy, we'd still be faced with the fact that we are putting short-term economic strength against long term--potentially permanent--worldwide devastation as a result of our refusal to truly address our role in heating Earth's climate. It's kind of like refusing to have the enormous, ever-widening hole in your roof fixed because you're worried the roofers will trample your flower bed.
From McClatchy Newspapers:
Now that the House of Representatives has voted to repeal the health care law, Republicans say they're likely to move soon to another target  � a rewrite of the Clean Air Act so that it can't be used to fight climate change.
[Dale Jamieson, a professor of environmental studies and philosophy at New York University] argued, it's in our interest to clean up emissions, "but we're afraid to let go of this business-as-usual model."
Upton and Phillips [president of Americans for Prosperity], who said they're "not convinced" that any greenhouse gas regulation is needed, argued, "Cuts in carbon emission would mean significantly higher electricity prices."

      <title>SciFri Blog:Social Networking's Hidden Tradeoff</title>
      <link>http://www.sciencefriday.com/blog/?p=1652</link>
      <description><![CDATA[ We all love free stuff. Whether it's tiny sample tooth paste tubes or a free smartphone app. But don't you wonder why people give away stuff for nothin' (or is this just the cynical New  Yorker in me)?  

Well, it turns out that there is a tradeoff for that free iPhone or Android app, or that free "extension" to  your web browser. In many cases when you install it, the freebie takes a bit of your personal browsing information and sends it back to the app designer who may then sell it to a third party or use it to sell you something.  

For example, that bit.ly link shortener.  I use it all the time. But until I spoke to one of the bit.ly software folks, I thought that shortener was a public service. Naive me. When your link gets sent to bit.ly to be sliced and diced, those folks learn something about your preferences. After all,  you just told them what site you are visiting, no?

There is a HUGE amount of such data being collected and massaged. And what's being done with it is the topic of a Science Friday hour with Hillary Mason, lead scientist at bit.ly.   Take a listen and you might learn what happens to your info...and what the the "ly"in bit.ly means. Care to take a guess...and why? ]]></description>
