It looks like Sprint couldn't wait to share its version of the BlackBerry Bold 9650 with the world -- it went on sale online today, a week before its scheduled May 23rd launch. You're looking at $199 on a two-year deal, but unless you're dying for a new 'berry we can't say we're finding this Tour-with-an-optical-pad even remotely as exciting as the EVO 4G, which is due on June 4. But it's still quite handsome, right? That's... something.
