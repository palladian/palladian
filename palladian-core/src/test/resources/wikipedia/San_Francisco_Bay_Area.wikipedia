The '''San Francisco Bay Area''', commonly known as '''the Bay Area''', is a populated region that surrounds the [[San Francisco Bay|San Francisco]] and [[San Pablo Bay|San Pablo]] [[estuary|estuaries]] in [[Northern California]], [[United States]]. The region encompasses the major cities and metropolitan areas of [[San Francisco]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], along with smaller urban and rural areas.<ref name="bayareavision.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.bayareavision.org/bayarea/index.html |title=San Francisco Bay Area Vision Project |publisher=Bayareavision.org |accessdate=November 4, 2011}}</ref> The Bay Area's nine counties are [[Alameda County, California|Alameda]], [[Contra Costa County, California|Contra Costa]], [[Marin County, California|Marin]], [[Napa County, California|Napa]], [[San Francisco County, California|San Francisco]], [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo]], [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara]], [[Solano County, California|Solano]], and [[Sonoma County, California|Sonoma]].<ref name="bayareavision.org"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abag.ca.gov/ |title=The Association of Bay Area Governments |publisher=Abag.ca.gov |date=April 14, 2011 |accessdate=November 4, 2011}}</ref> Home to approximately 7.15 million people,<ref name="Bay Area Census"/> the nine-county Bay Area contains many cities, towns, airports, and associated regional, state, and [[national park]]s, connected by a network of roads, highways, railroads, bridges, tunnels and [[commuter rail]]. The combined urban area of San Jose and San Francisco is the largest in Northern California, the second largest in California (after [[Los Angeles]]), and the [[List of urban areas by population|56th largest urban area in the world]].

The United States [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB) does not use the nine-county definition of the San Francisco Bay Area.

==Sub-regions==

===East Bay===
{{Main|East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)}}
[[File:East Bay aerial twilight.jpg|thumb|right|South [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]], [[Oakland]], [[Alameda, California|Alameda]] and [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge|Bay Bridge]]]]

The eastern side of the bay, consisting of Alameda and Contra Costa counties, is known locally as the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]]. The East Bay can be loosely divided into two regions, the inner East Bay, which adjoins the Bay shoreline, and the outer East Bay, consisting of inland valleys separated from the inner East Bay by hills and mountains.
* The inner East Bay includes the western portions of Alameda and Contra Costa Counties, including the cities of [[Oakland]], [[Hayward, California|Hayward]], [[Fremont, California|Fremont]], [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], and [[Richmond, California|Richmond]], as well as many smaller suburbs such as [[Alameda, California|Alameda]], [[Castro Valley, California|Castro Valley]], [[Newark, California|Newark]], [[Union City, California|Union City]], [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]], [[Albany, California|Albany]], [[San Leandro, California|San Leandro]], [[San Pablo, California|San Pablo]], [[Crockett, California|Crockett]], [[El Sobrante, California|El Sobrante]], [[Pinole, California|Pinole]], [[San Lorenzo, California|San Lorenzo]], [[Hercules, California|Hercules]], [[Rodeo, California|Rodeo]], [[Piedmont, California|Piedmont]], and [[El Cerrito, Contra Costa County, California|El Cerrito]]. The inner East Bay is more densely populated, with generally older buildings, and a more ethnically diverse population. This region contains the Bay Area's largest [[seaport]], the [[Port of Oakland]], the headquarters of [[Pixar Animation Studios]], and hosts the professional sports franchises the [[Golden State Warriors]], [[Oakland Raiders]], and [[Oakland Athletics]].
* The outer East Bay consists of the eastern portions of [[Alameda County, California|Alameda]] and [[Contra Costa County, California|Contra Costa]] counties and is divided into 4 distinct areas: Lamorinda, Central Contra Costa County, East Contra Costa County, and the [[Tri-Valley]]. The word Lamorinda was coined by combining the names of the cities it includes: [[Lafayette, California|Lafayette]], [[Moraga, California|Moraga]], and [[Orinda, California|Orinda]]. [[Walnut Creek, California|Walnut Creek]] is situated east of Lamorinda and north of the San Ramon Valley and, together with [[Concord, California|Concord]], [[Martinez, California|Martinez]], and [[Pleasant Hill, California|Pleasant Hill]] comprises ''Central Contra Costa County''. The cities of [[Antioch, California|Antioch]], [[Pittsburg, California|Pittsburg]], [[Brentwood, California|Brentwood]], [[Oakley, California|Oakley]] and the unincorporated areas surrounding them comprise ''East Contra Costa County''. The [[Tri-Valley]] consists of the [[Amador Valley|Amador]], the [[Livermore Valley|Livermore]], and the [[San Ramon Valley]]s. [[Dublin, California|Dublin]] and [[Pleasanton, California|Pleasanton]] comprise the [[Amador Valley]], [[Livermore, California|Livermore]] lies in the [[Livermore Valley]], and the [[San Ramon Valley]] consists of [[Alamo, California|Alamo]], [[Danville, California|Danville]], [[Diablo, California|Diablo]] and its namesake, [[San Ramon, California|San Ramon]]. The outer East Bay is connected to the inner East Bay (East/West) by [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]], Interstate [[Interstate 580 (California)|580]] to the south, and State Routes [[California State Route 4|State Route 4]] to the north, and [[California State Route 24|State Route 24]] via the [[Caldecott Tunnel]] in the center. The outer East Bay's infrastructure was mostly built up after World War II. This area remains largely white demographically, although the Hispanic and Filipino populations have grown significantly over the past 2–3 decades.

===North Bay===
{{Main|North Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)}}

[[File:Lightmatter napa valley.jpg|right|thumb|250px|right|[[Napa Valley]] is most famous for its wine.]]

The region north of the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] is known locally as the North Bay. This area encompasses [[Marin County, California|Marin County]], [[Sonoma County, California|Sonoma County]], [[Napa County, California|Napa County]] and extends eastward into [[Solano County, California|Solano County]]. The city of [[Fairfield, California|Fairfield]], being part of Solano County, is often considered the easternmost city of the North Bay.

With few exceptions, this region is quite affluent: Marin County is ranked as the wealthiest in the state. The North Bay is relatively rural compared to the remainder of the Bay Area, with many areas of undeveloped open space, farmland and vineyards. [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]] in Sonoma County is the North Bay's largest city, with a population of 167,815 and a [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]] population of 466,891, making it the fifth largest city in the San Francisco Bay Area.

The North Bay is the only section of the Bay Area that is not currently served by a commuter rail service. The lack of transportation services is mainly because of the lack of population mass in the North Bay, and the fact that it is separated completely from the rest of the Bay Area by water, the only access points being the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] leading to San Francisco, the [[Richmond-San Rafael Bridge|Richmond-San Rafael]] and [[Carquinez Bridge]]s leading to [[Richmond, California|Richmond]], and the [[Benicia-Martinez Bridge]] leading to [[Martinez, California|Martinez]].

===Peninsula===
{{Main|San Francisco Peninsula}}

[[File:Colma-california-panoramic1w.jpg|thumb|750px|center|View of [[Colma, California]], looking down from [[San Bruno Mountain]] ]]

The area from San Francisco to the Silicon Valley, geographically part of the [[San Francisco Peninsula]], is known locally as ''The Peninsula''. This area consists of a series of cities and suburban communities in [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo County]] and the northwestern part of [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]], as well as various towns along the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast, such as [[Pacifica, California|Pacifica]] and [[Half Moon Bay, California|Half Moon Bay]]. This area is extremely diverse. Many of the cities and towns had originally been centers of rural life until the post-World War II era when large numbers of middle and upper class Bay Area residents moved in and developed the small villages. Since the 1980s the area has seen a large growth rate of middle and upper-class families who have settled in cities like [[Palo Alto]], [[Los Altos, California|Los Altos]], [[Portola Valley]], [[Woodside, California|Woodside]], and [[Atherton, California|Atherton]] as part of the technology boom of Silicon Valley. Many of these families are of foreign background and have significantly contributed to the diversity of the area. Peninsula cities include: [[Atherton, California|Atherton]], [[Belmont, California|Belmont]], [[Brisbane, California|Brisbane]], [[Burlingame, California|Burlingame]], [[Colma, California|Colma]], [[Daly City]], East Palo Alto, [[Foster City]], [[Half Moon Bay, California|Half Moon Bay]], [[Hillsborough, California|Hillsborough]], [[Los Altos, California|Los Altos]], [[Los Altos Hills, California|Los Altos Hills]], [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]], [[Millbrae]], [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]], [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], [[Pacifica, California|Pacifica]], [[Portola Valley, California|Portola Valley]], [[Redwood City, California|Redwood City]], [[Redwood Shores, California|Redwood Shores]], [[San Bruno]], [[San Carlos, California|San Carlos]], [[San Mateo, California|San Mateo]], [[South San Francisco]] and Woodside.

Whereas the term ''peninsula'' technically refers to the entire geographical San Franciscan Peninsula, in local terms, ''The Peninsula'' does not include the city of San Francisco itself.<ref name="Crawford2006">{{cite book|last=Crawford|first=Sabrina|title=Newcomer's Handbook for Moving to And Living in the San Francisco Bay Area: Including San Jose, Oakland, Berkeley, And Palo Alto|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oRubZ8uW1FYC&pg=PA130|accessdate=9 February 2013|date=2006-01-31|publisher=First Books|isbn=978-0-912301-63-1|pages=130–}}</ref><ref name="Inc.1987">{{cite book|last=Inc.|first=Active Interest Media,|title=Old-House Journal|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ly2pGzVspoYC&pg=PA18|accessdate=9 February 2013|date=1987-06|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|pages=18–}}</ref><ref name="Cass2009">{{cite book|last=Cass|first=Maxine|title=Northern California Off the Beaten Path: A Guide to Unique Places|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Rgm7rGu-D1IC&pg=PA55|accessdate=9 February 2013|date=2009-07-01|publisher=Globe Pequot|isbn=978-0-7627-5597-4|pages=55–}}</ref>

===San Francisco===
{{Main|San Francisco}}
[[File:SanFrancisco from TwinPeaks dusk MC.jpg|thumb|800px|center|San Francisco panorama from Twin Peaks.]]

San Francisco is surrounded by water on three sides; the north, east, and west.  The city squeezes approximately 805,000 people in under {{convert|46.9|sqmi|km2}}, making it the most densely populated major city in North America after New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfmayor.org/index.aspx?page=281 |title=Office of the Mayor : Mayor Lee Announces U.S. Census Bureau Results for San Francisco Population |publisher=Sfmayor.org |accessdate=November 4, 2011}}</ref> On any given day, there can be as many as 1 million people in the city because of the [[commuting]] population and tourism. San Francisco also has the largest commuter population of the Bay Area cities. The limitations of land area, however, make continued population growth challenging, and also has resulted in increased real estate prices. Though San Francisco is located at the tip of the peninsula, when ''the peninsula'' is discussed, it usually refers to the communities and geographic locations south of the city proper. <ref> Young, T. (2004). "Building San Francisco's parks", 1850-1930, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press </ref>

===San Jose and Silicon Valley===
{{Main|South Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)}}
[[File:Panoramic Downtown San Jose.jpg|thumb|800px|center|A panorama over [[Downtown San Jose|Downtown]] [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]]]

The communities at the southern region of the San Francisco Bay Area are primarily located in what is known as [[Silicon Valley]], or the [[Santa Clara Valley]]. These include the major city of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], and its suburbs, including the high-tech hubs of [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]], [[Milpitas, California|Milpitas]], [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino]], [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]] as well as many other cities like [[Saratoga, California|Saratoga]], [[Campbell, California|Campbell]], [[Los Gatos, California|Los Gatos]] and the [[commuter town|exurbs]] of [[Morgan Hill, California|Morgan Hill]] and [[Gilroy, California|Gilroy]]. Some [[San Francisco Peninsula|Peninsula]] and [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]] towns are sometimes recognized as being in the Santa Clara Valley. Generally, the term South Bay refers to Santa Clara County, but the northwest portion of the county (Palo Alto, Mountain View, Los Altos and Los Altos Hills) is considered part of the [[San Francisco Peninsula|Peninsula]] (even though these cities are in Santa Clara County).

Silicon Valley was primarily an agricultural center from the time of California's founding until World War II. During and after the war, working and middle-class families migrated to the area to settle and work in the burgeoning aerospace and electronics industries. The South Bay Area experienced rapid growth as agriculture was gradually replaced by high-technology. During this period, the Santa Clara Valley gradually became an urbanized metropolitan region. Today, the growth continues, fueled primarily by technology jobs, the weather, and immigrant labor. Urbanization is gradually replacing suburbanization as the population density of the valley increases. This trend has resulted in a huge increase in property values, forcing many middle-class families out of the area or into lower income neighborhoods in older sections of the region. The Santa Clara Valley also came to be known as Silicon Valley,  as the area became the premier technology center of the United States. Some [[Silicon Valley#Notable companies|notable tech companies headquartered in the South Bay]] are [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]], [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]], [[Intel Corporation|Intel]], [[Netflix]], [[Cisco Systems]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Google]], [[eBay]], [[Facebook]] and [[Yahoo!]]. Largely a result of the high technology sector, the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]] has the most millionaires and the most billionaires in the United States per capita.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/2007/11/30/greediest-cities-billionaires-forbeslife-cx_ee_1203greed.html | work=Forbes | title=America's Greediest Cities | date=December 3, 2007}}</ref>

The population of the entire valley is part of the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara metropolitan area, which has about 2 million residents. San Jose, the largest city in the Silicon Valley area, is the tenth most populous city in the United States and the most populous city in the Bay Area. San Jose is the oldest city in California and was its first capital. The city prides itself on being an environmentally conscious city. It recycles a greater percentage of its waste than any other large American city. Over the past several decades, the South Bay Area has experienced rapid growth. To limit the effects of [[urban sprawl]], planned communities were laid out to control growth. [[Urban growth boundary|Urban growth boundaries]] have been established to protect remaining open space (primarily in the surrounding hills and southern border) from development. Most new growth has been [[urban infill]] in the form of [[high density housing]] to increase density rate. The growth rate has slowed, but the area continues to have steady growth.

San Jose is home to many sports teams both amateur and professional, such as the [[San Jose Sharks]] of the [[NHL]], and the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] of the [[Major League Soccer|MLS]].

The South Bay has a large transportation infrastructure that includes many freeways, [[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority|VTA]] bus service and light rail, [[Amtrak]], and commuter rail such as [[Caltrain]]. The [[San Jose International Airport]] serves air traffic in the South Bay Area and is conveniently located just north of downtown in the center of Silicon Valley. The height of buildings in [[Downtown San Jose|Downtown]] is limited (due to [[FAA]] regulations and city ordinance) because it is situated directly under the flight path. The South Bay is poised to have a more efficient transportation network with the extension of the [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] system to San Jose, which would allow elevated/[[Rapid transit|subway]] travel into San Francisco. San Jose will also be a major stop on the proposed [[California High-Speed Rail]] system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vta.org/bart/index.html |title=Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority |publisher=Vta.org |accessdate=November 4, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube|_Nx8rNysZSI|California High-Speed Trains: Visual Tour}}</ref>

===Santa Cruz and San Benito===
{{Main|Santa Cruz County, California|San Benito County, California}}
Whether [[Santa Cruz County, California|Santa Cruz]] and [[San Benito County|San Benito]] counties are considered part of the San Francisco Bay Area depends on the observer. For example, the regional governments in the San Francisco Bay Area, including the [[Association of Bay Area Governments]], the [[Metropolitan Transportation Commission (San Francisco Bay Area)|Metropolitan Transportation Commission]], the [[Bay Area Air Quality Management District|Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD)]], and the [[California State Water Resources Control Board#Regional Water Quality Control Boards|San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB)]] include only the nine counties above in their boundaries or membership. (The BAAQMD includes all of the nine counties except the northern portions of Sonoma and Solano; the RWQCB includes all of San Francisco and the portions of the other eight counties that drain to San Francisco Bay or to the Pacific Ocean.)<ref>[http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/sanfranciscobay/body_boundary.html Regional Water Quality Control Board, San Francisco Bay Region (2) Boundaries]. Retrieved 2007-02-20. {{Wayback | url=http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/sanfranciscobay/body_boundary.html  | date=20061231080639 }}</ref> However, the [[United States Census Bureau]] defines the San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland Consolidated Statistical Area as an eleven-county region, including the nine counties above plus Santa Cruz and San Benito Counties. Meanwhile, the California State Parks Department defines the Bay Area as including ten counties,<ref name=parks>{{cite web | url = http://www.parks.ca.gov/parkindex/region_info.asp?regiontab=0&id=5 | title = Find a park – San Francisco Bay Area Region | publisher = California State Parks | accessdate =June 20, 2006}}</ref> including Santa Cruz but excluding San Benito. On the other hand, Santa Cruz and San Benito along with [[Monterey County]] are part of a different regional government organization called the [[Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments]]. Local media in the San Francisco Bay Area and travel guides often consider these two counties as part of the South Bay subregion, as they are greatly connected geographically, economically, and historically.<ref>http://www.visitcalifornia.com/media/pages/getting_around/maps/SAN-FRANCISCO.pdf</ref><!-- Official California visitor's bureau map of Bay Area, Sonoma/Napa counties map in Wine Country section  --><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2011/07/27/homeless-population-rises-in-santa-cruz-decreases-in-santa-clara/ |title=Homeless Population Rises In Santa Cruz Co., Decreases In Santa Clara Co. « CBS San Francisco |publisher=Sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com |date=July 27, 2011 |accessdate=November 4, 2011}}</ref><!-- Article about Santa Cruz County in "local" section --><ref>{{cite web|last=Preuitt |first=Lori |url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Earthquake-Shakes-Aromas-100312044.html |title=Earthquake Shakes Aromas |publisher=NBC Bay Area |date=August 9, 2010 |accessdate=November 4, 2011}}</ref><!-- Article in "local" section --><ref>{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/channel?section=news/local/south_bay&id=7102664 |title=South Bay, San Jose and Silicon Valley Local News &#124; abc7news.com |publisher=Abclocal.go.com |date=November 5, 2009 |accessdate=November 4, 2011}}</ref><!-- Articles about Santa Cruz/San Benito Counties can be found --><ref>{{cite web|url=http://radioalice.radio.com/2011/06/30/where-in-the-bay-can-i-see-fireworks/3/ |title=Where In The Bay Can I See Fireworks? |publisher=Radioalice.radio.com |date=June 30, 2011 |accessdate=November 4, 2011}}</ref><!-- Bay Area event list -->

The [[Silicon Valley]] is located within the southern reaches of the Bay Area. The leading high technology region in the world, Silicon Valley covers San Jose and several cities of South Bay. The Valley is home to many of the industry leaders in technology such as [[Google]], [[Yahoo!]], [[Facebook]], [[Cisco]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Marvell Technology Group|Marvell]], [[Intel]], and [[Hewlett-Packard]]. Major corporations in San Francisco, San Jose, Oakland, and the surrounding cities help make the region second in the nation in concentration of Fortune 500 companies, after New York.<ref name="The Fortune 500, 2010">{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2010/|title=Fortune 500 2010: Annual ranking of America's largest corporations from Fortune Magazine|accessdate=August 11, 2010 | work=CNN}}</ref> The region's northern counties encompass California's famous [[Wine Country (California)|Wine Country]], home to hundreds of vineyards and wineries.  The Bay Area is a leader in [[sustainable agriculture]], [[organic farming]], and [[sustainable energy]] and for being a leading producer of high quality food, wine, and innovation in the [[culinary arts]]. [[California Cuisine]] was developed primarily in the Bay Area, as was the organic farming movement.  The area is renowned for its natural beauty.

The San Francisco Bay Area is one of the wealthiest regions in the United States, due, primarily, to the economic power engines of San Francisco, [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. [[Pleasanton, California|Pleasanton]] has the second highest household income in the country after New Canaan, CT.  However, discretionary income is very comparable with the rest of the country, primarily because the higher cost of living offsets the increased income.<ref name=affluence>{{cite web | url = http://www.insidebayarea.com/sanmateocountytimes/localnews/ci_4259660 | title = Pleasanton tops county in median household income | publisher = Inside Bay Area | accessdate =October 15, 2006|archiveurl = http://wayback.archive.org/web/20110606141112/http://www.insidebayarea.com/sanmateocountytimes/localnews/ci_4259660 |archivedate = June 6, 2011|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

==Politics==
The San Francisco Bay Area is widely regarded as one of the most liberal areas in the country. According to the [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] (CPVI), [[congressional districts]] the Bay Area tends to favor [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates by roughly 40 to 50 percentage points, considerably above the mean for California and the nation overall. All congressional districts in the region voted for Democrat [[Barack Obama]] over Republican [[John McCain]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 Presidential Election]].
Over the last four and a half decades the 9-county Bay Area voted for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidates only twice, once in 1972 for [[Richard Nixon]] and again in [[:Category:1980 in politics|1980]] for [[Ronald Reagan]], both Californians. The last county to vote for a Republican Presidential candidate was [[Napa County, California|Napa county]] in 1988 for [[George H. W. Bush]]. Districts were renumbered and boundaries changed after the 2010 census in accordance with new, less partisan, redistricting and primary election rules and procedures (see [[Politics of California]]), but with little effect within the Bay Area.

Because the hills, mountains, and large bodies of water produce such vast geographic diversity within this region, the San Francisco Bay Area offers a significant variety of [[microclimate]]s. The areas near the Pacific Ocean are generally characterized by relatively small temperature variations during the year, with cool foggy summers and mild rainy winters. Inland areas, especially those separated from the ocean by hills or mountains, have hotter summers and colder overnight temperatures during the winter. San Jose at the south end of the Bay averages fewer than {{convert|15|in|mm}} of rain annually, while Napa at the north end of the Bay averages over 30 and parts of the Santa Cruz Mountains just a few miles west of San Jose get over 55. In the summer, inland regions can be over 40 degrees Fahrenheit (22 degrees Celsius) warmer than the coast. This large temperature contrast induces a strong pressure gradient, which results in brisk coastal winds which help keep the coastal climate cool and typically foggy during the summer. Additionally, strong winds are produced through gaps in the coastal ranges such as the [[Golden Gate]], the [[Carquinez Strait]], and the [[Altamont Pass]], the latter the site of extensive [[wind farm]]s. During the fall and winter seasons, when not stormy, a high pressure area is usually present inland, leading to an offshore flow. While negatively impacting air quality, this also clears fog away from the Pacific shore, and so the best weather in San Francisco can usually be found from mid September through mid October. Winter storms are typically wet and mild in temperature during this time of year, being caused by cold fronts sweeping the eastern Pacific and often originating in the [[Gulf of Alaska]]. During November into mid March, winter storms are usually several days in length, wet and cool, with severely damaging storms rare. There is also recorded snowfall on San Francisco Bay Area peaks, such as Mount St. Helena, Tamalpais, Diablo and Hamilton. Snow levels range every given year from 1000&nbsp;feet in Sonoma County to 2,000&nbsp;ft in Contra Costa, San Mateo, and Santa Clara counties the during the winter. Greater recorded snowfall amounts are generally recorded once every 5 to 10 years.  In February 2001, 30&nbsp;inches (76&nbsp;cm) of snow fell on Mount Hamilton (4360&nbsp;ft), 17&nbsp;inches on Mount Tamalpais (2,574&nbsp;ft) and 10&nbsp;inches on Mount Diablo (3,864&nbsp;ft). Occasionally during the late Summer or early Autumn, spells of warm humid weather will drift over the Bay Area from the [[North American Monsoon|Southwest Monsoon]] or from the residue of Western Pacific hurricanes near Mexico, usually bringing high variable clouds as well, and more rarely, high-based [[thunderstorm]]s.

==Ecology==
{{Main|Ecology of the San Francisco Estuary}}
[[File:Sfestuaryhistorical.gif|thumb|300px|right|San Francisco Bay ca. 1770–1820]]
Despite its urban and industrial character, San Francisco Bay and the [[Sacramento River Delta|Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta]] remain perhaps California's most important ecological [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]]. California's [[Dungeness crab]], Pacific [[halibut]], and Pacific [[salmon]] [[fisheries]] rely on the bay as a nursery. The few remaining [[salt marsh]]es now represent most of California's remaining salt marsh, supporting a number of endangered [[species]] and providing key ecosystem services such as filtering pollutants and [[sediment]]s from the rivers. Most famously, the bay is a key link in the [[Pacific Flyway]]. Millions of [[waterfowl]] annually use the bay shallows as a refuge. Two [[endangered species]] of birds are found here: the [[California least tern]] and the [[California clapper rail]]. Exposed [[bay mud]]s provide important feeding areas for [[shorebird]]s, but underlying layers of bay mud pose geological hazards for structures near many parts of the bay perimeter. San Francisco Bay provided the nation's first wildlife refuge, Oakland's artificial [[Lake Merritt]] (constructed in the 1860s) and America's first urban National Wildlife Refuge, the [[Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge]] (SFBNWR) (1972). The Bay is also invaded by non-native species.

[[Steelhead trout]] (''Oncorhynchus mykiss'') populations in California have dramatically declined due to human and natural causes.  The Central California Coast [[distinct population segment]] (DPS) was listed as threatened under the [[Endangered Species Act|Federal Endangered Species Act]] on August 18, 1997; threatened status was reaffirmed on January 5, 2006. This DPS includes all naturally spawned [[Fish migration|anadromous]] steelhead populations below natural and manmade impassable barriers in California streams from the [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]] to [[Aptos Creek]], and the drainages of San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun Bays.<ref>{{cite report |title=Central California Coast Steelhead DPS |publisher=NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service Northwest Regional Office |url=http://www.nwr.noaa.gov/ESA-Salmon-Listings/Salmon-Populations/Steelhead/STCCC.cfm |accessdate=Feb. 15, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Map showing endangered species status of west coast steelhead |publisher=[[Alameda Creek]] Alliance |url=http://www.alamedacreek.org/Steelhead%20trout/steelhead%20listing%20status.gif |accessdate=Feb. 14, 2010 }}</ref> The U.S. [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] has a [http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/fish/salmon.htm detailed description of threats].

The [[National Park Service]] has made major recent investments in restoring the tidal wetlands at the mouths of [[Lagunitas Creek]] and [[Redwood Creek (Marin County)|Redwood Creek]] including levee removal and placement of large woody debris in the creeks, which provide shelter to salmonids during heavy stream flows and flooding. Lagunitas Creek's coho population is especially important, as 80% of the ESU depends on this stream draining the north slope of [[Mount Tamalpais]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=California Coho Salmon In Dire Straits |author=Donna Whitmarsh |journal=Bay Nature |date=Jan. 2010 }}</ref> This year's coho count dropped to 64 from an average of 600 in previous years.<ref name=Science />

[[File:Burrowing Owl Family in Antioch.jpg|thumb |250px |left |Family of owls turned out of their homes in Antioch]]
[[Burrowing owl|Western Burrowing Owls]] (''Athene cunicularia'') were listed as a [[California species of special concern|Species of Special Concern]] (a pre-listing category under the Endangered Species Act) by the [[California Department of Fish and Game]] in 1979. California's population declined 60% from the 1980s to the early '90s, and continues to decline at roughly 8% per year.<ref>{{cite news |title=Owl Be Damned:Developers plow into the homes of the burrowing owl |author=Rendon, JIm |newspaper=Metro, Silicon Valley's Weekly Newspaper |date=Nov.-Dec., 1999 |url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/11.24.99/cover/species5-9947.html }}</ref> In 1994, the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] nominated the Western Burrowing Owl as a Federal Category 2 candidate for listing as endangered or threatened, but loss of habitat continues due to development of the flat, grassy lands used by the owl.

Much of the SFBNWR consists of salt [[evaporation]] ponds acquired from the [[Leslie Salt Company]] and its successor, [[Cargill|Cargill Corporation]] through a series of land sales and donations. Many of these salt ponds remain in operation and produce salt used throughout the Western United States in food, agriculture, industry and medicine.  The refuge pond support dense populations of [[brine shrimp]], and therefore serving as feeding areas for waterfowl. In 2003, the US Fish & Wildlife Service and California Department of Fish & Game entered one of the largest private land purchases in American history, with the state and federal governments paying $100 million for 15,100 acres (65&nbsp;km²) of salt ponds (which government appraisers valued at $243 million prior to the acquisition) in the south bay and 1,400 acres near the Napa River. SFBNWR and state biologists hope to restore some of the recently purchased ponds as [[tide|tidal]] wetlands.[[File:River otter Richmond Marina Scott Campbell July 29, 2010.jpg|thumb |250px |left |River Otter sunning on rocks in the [[Richmond, California|Richmond Marina]]]]

[[Humphrey the Whale]], a [[humpback whale]] (''Megaptera novaeangliae''), entered San Francisco Bay twice on errant migrations, and was successfully rescued and redirected each time in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This occurred again with [[Dawn and Delta]] a mother and calf in 2007.

The seasonal range of water temperature in the Bay is from about 8&nbsp;°C (46&nbsp;°F) to about 23&nbsp;°C (73&nbsp;°F).

Industrial, mining, and other uses of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] have resulted in a widespread distribution of that poisonous metal in the bay, with uptake in the bay's [[phytoplankton]] and contamination of its sportfish.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Rev Environ Contam Toxicol |year=2008 |volume=194 |pages=29–54 |title= Mercury in the San Francisco Estuary |author= Conaway CH, Black FJ, Grieb TM, Roy S, Flegal AR |pmid=18069645 |doi=10.1007/978-0-387-74816-0_2 |series= Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology |isbn= 978-0-387-74815-3}}</ref> In November 2007, a ship named ''[[Cosco Busan]]'' collided with the San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge and spilled over 58,000 gallons of bunker fuel, creating the largest [[oil spill]] in the region since 1996.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-bay9nov09,1,1303799.story?coll=la-headlines-california |title=Oil oozes in S.F.

In March, 2012 a [[Bald eagle]] (''Haliaeetus leucocephalus'') nest was reported on the northwest arm of [[Crystal Springs Reservoir|Lower Crystal Springs Reservoir]] and upper [[San Mateo Creek (San Francisco Bay Area)|San Mateo Creek]]. This is the first bald eagle breeding pair on the [[San Francisco Peninsula]] since 1915, when they nested in [[La Honda, California|La Honda]], almost one hundred years ago. The birds were once common in the Bay Area. While visiting [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]] in 1855, physician naturalist [[James Graham Cooper|James G. Cooper]] described "a nest of this bird large enough to fill a wagon, built in a large [[California sycamore|sycamore]] tree, standing alone in the prairie. Habitat destruction and thinning of eggs from (now banned) [[DDT]] poisoning reduced the California state population to 35 nesting pairs at their lowest point. In the 1980s re-introductions began with the [[Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group]] and the [[San Francisco Zoo]] began importing birds and eggs from [[Vancouver Island]] and northeastern California in the late 1980s.<ref>{{cite news |title=Eagles reappear in San Mateo County after nearly century absence |author=Lisa M.

==Geology and landforms==
[[File:Glen Canyon Park Chert Outcrop.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A portion of the [[Franciscan Assemblage]] (former seabed), one of the terrane types]]

===Multiple terrains===
The area is well known worldwide for the complexity of its landforms, the region being composed of at least six [[terrane]]s ([[continent]]al, [[seabed]], or [[island arc]] fragments with distinct characteristics) pushed together over many millions of years by the forces of [[plate tectonics]]. Nine out of eleven distinct ''assemblages'' have been identified in a single county (Alameda).<ref>[http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1996/of96-252/ Alameda County geologic map] USGS publication</ref><ref>[http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1996/of96-252/algeo.pdf Preliminary  geologic map emphasizing bedrock formations in Alameda Couty, California: A digital database] USGS Publication (Geologic explation of map noted above)</ref> Diverse assemblages adjoin in complex arrangements due to offsets along the many faults (both active and stable) in the area. As a consequence, many types of rock and soil are found in the region. Formations include the [[sedimentary|sedimentary rocks]] of [[sandstone]], [[limestone]], and [[shale]] in uplifted seabeds, [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] [[Serpentine group|serpentine]] rock, coal deposits, and [[igneous]] forms such as basalt flows, rhyolite outcroppings, granite associated with the [[Salinian Block]] west of the San Andreas Fault, and ash deposits of extinct yet relatively recently active  (10 million years) [[volcano]]s. [[Pleistocene|Pleistocene-era]] [[fossil]]s of mammals are abundantly present in some locations.

===Vertical relief===
The region has considerable vertical relief in its landscapes that are not in the [[alluvial plain]]s leading to the bay or in inland valleys. In combination with the extensive water regions this has forced the fragmented development of urban and suburban regions and has led to extensive building on poor soils in the limited flatland areas and considerable expense in connecting the various [[subregion]]s with roads, tunnels, and bridges.
[[File:BayareaUSGS.jpg|thumb|USGS satellite photo of the Bay Area taken in 1999. Gray areas are highly urbanized.]]
[[File:San Francisco Bay NASA World Wind Globe.jpg|thumb|NASA satellite photo]]
Several mountains are associated with some of the many ridge and hill structures created by compressive forces between the Pacific Plate and the North American plate. These provide spectacular views (in appropriate weather) of large portions of the Bay Area and include Marin County's [[Mount Tamalpais]] at 2,571&nbsp;feet (784&nbsp;m). Contra Costa County's [[Mount Diablo]] at 3,849&nbsp;feet (1,173&nbsp;m), Alameda County's [[Mission Peak]] at 2,517 to 2,604&nbsp;feet (767 to 776&nbsp;m), and Santa Clara County's [[Mount Hamilton (California)|Mount Hamilton]] at 4,213&nbsp;ft (1,284&nbsp;m), the latter with significant astronomical studies performed at its crowning [[Lick Observatory]]. Though Tamalpais and Mission Peak are quite lower than the others, Tamalpais has no other peaks and few hills nearby. Mission Peak is coast facing and is an interior mountain and therefore has excellent views of both sides.

The three major ridge structures (part of the [[Pacific Coast Range]]) which are all roughly parallel to the major faultlines:
* The [[Santa Cruz Mountains]] along the San Francisco Peninsula and the [[Marin Hills]] in Marin County ([[San Andreas Fault]])
* The [[Berkeley Hills]], [[San Leandro Hills]] and their southern ridgeline extension through [[Mission Peak]] ([[Hayward Fault]])
* The [[Diablo Range]], which includes [[Mount Diablo]] and [[Mount Hamilton (California)|Mount Hamilton]] ([[Calaveras Fault]])

===Major waterways===

===Earthquake faults===
[[File:Flat eq map anotated.png|left|thumb|250px|Map showing some of the major faults in the Bay Area. Numerous minor faults are also capable of generating locally destructive earthquakes.]]
The region is also traversed by six major slip-strike fault systems with hundreds of related faults, many of which are "sister faults" of the infamous [[San Andreas Fault]], all of which are stressed by the relative motion between the [[Pacific Plate]] and the [[North American Plate]] or by compressive stresses between these plates. The fault systems include the [[Hayward Fault Zone]], [[Calaveras Fault]], [[Clayton-Marsh Creek-Greenville Fault]], and the [[San Gregorio Fault]]. Significant blind [[thrust fault]]s (faults with near vertical motion and no surface ruptures) are associated with portions of the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]] and the northern reaches of the [[Diablo Range]] and [[Mount Diablo]].

==Natural hazards==

===Earthquakes===
[[File:Eq-prob.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Probalities for major earthquakes on Bay Area faults]]
The region is particularly exposed to hazards associated with large earthquakes,<ref>{{cite web|author=Expiration: 11.09.11 |url=http://quake.abag.ca.gov/ |title=Maps and information about Bay Area threats including earthquakes, landslides, and tsunamis.|publisher=Quake.abag.ca.gov |accessdate=November 4, 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/nca/1868virtualtour/bayarea.php/ USGS site with Google Earth KMZ files related to geology and seismic activity]</ref> owing to a combination of factors:
* Numerous major active faults in the region.
* A combined thirty-year probability of a major earthquake in excess of seventy percent.
* Poorly responding native soil conditions in many places near the bay and in inland valleys, soils which amplify shaking as shown in the map to the right.
* Large areas of filled marshlands and bay mud that are significantly urbanized, with most subject to [[earthquake liquefaction|liquefaction]], becoming unable to support structures.
* A large inventory of older buildings, many of which are expected to perform poorly in a major earthquake.
* Extensive building in areas subject to [[landslide]], [[mudslide]], and in some locations directly over active fault surface rubble zones.
* Most lowrise construction is not fireproof and water systems are likely to be extensively damaged and so large areas are subject to destruction by fire after a large earthquake.
* The coastal location makes the region vulnerable to Pacific Ocean [[tsunami]]s.<ref>[http://wcatwc.arh.noaa.gov/web_tsus/19600522/damage.htm Describes Bay Area damage from 1960 tsunami.] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5ySDIpxkG|date =May 5, 2011}}</ref>

Some of these hazards are being addressed by [[seismic retrofit]]ting, education in household seismic safety, and even complete replacement of major structures such as the [[Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge|eastern span of the San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge]].

===Flooding===
Some flooding occurs on local drainages under sustained wet conditions when the ground becomes saturated, more frequently in the North Bay area, which tends to receive substantially more rainfall than the South Bay. In one case, the [[Napa River]] drainage, floodplain developments are being purchased and removed and natural wetlands restored in the innovative [[Napa River Flood Project]] as the previous [[river engineering#Channelization|channelization]] of insufficient capacity around such developments was causing flooding problems upstream. Many of the local creeks have been channelized, although modern practice, and some restoration work includes returning the creeks to a natural state with dry [[stormwater]] bypasses constructed to handle flooding. While quite expensive, the restoration of a natural environment is of high priority in the intensively urbanized areas of the region.

===Windstorms and wildfires===
Typically between late November and early March, a very strong Pacific storm can bring both substantial rainfall (saturating and weakening soil) and strong wind gusts that can cause trees to fall on power lines. Owing to the wide area involved (sometimes hundreds of miles of coast), electrical service can be interrupted for up to several days in some more remote localities, but service is usually restored quickly in urban areas. These storms occasionally bring lightning & thunder. More rarely they even spawn tornadoes. For example, during the abnormal hurricane-like storm in early 2010, a funnel cloud sparked an extremely rare Tornado Warning in [[Morgan Hill]].

In the spring and fall, [[Diablo wind|strong offshore winds]] periodically develop. These winds are an especially dangerous fire hazard in the fall when vegetation is at its driest, as exemplified historically by the [[1923 Berkeley Fire]] and the [[Oakland Firestorm of 1991|1991 Oakland Firestorm]].

===Mudslides and landslides===
Some geologically unstable areas have been extensively urbanized, and can become mobile due to changes in drainage patterns and grading created for development. These are usually confined to small areas, but there have been larger problems in the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]].

==Transportation==
{{Main|Transportation in the Bay Area}}
[[File:SF Bay Rail Transit.svg|thumb|The Bay Area is served by a variety of rail transit systems, primarily by [[BART|Bay Area Rapid Transit]] and [[Caltrain]].]]
[[File:San Francisco Bay bridges.svg|thumb|right|(1) [[Richmond-San Rafael Bridge]], (2) [[Golden Gate Bridge]], (3) [[San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge]], (4) [[San Mateo-Hayward Bridge]], (5) [[Dumbarton Bridge (California)|Dumbarton Bridge]], (6) [[Carquinez Bridge]], (7) [[Benicia-Martinez Bridge]] ]]
The Bay Area is served by many [[public transportation]] <!-- are airports considered public transport? aren't they more like air taxis? -->systems, including three international airports ([[San Francisco International Airport|SFO]], [[Oakland International Airport|OAK]], [[Mineta San Jose International Airport|SJC]]), six major overlapping [[bus]] transit agencies ([[AC Transit]], [[San Francisco Muni|Muni]], [[SamTrans]], [[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority|VTA]], [[Golden Gate Transit]], [[County Connection]]), in addition to dozens of smaller ones. There are four [[rapid transit]] and [[regional rail]] systems including [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] and [[Caltrain]] and two [[light rail]] systems ([[San Francisco Muni Metro]] and [[VTA Light-rail]]). There are also several regional rail lines provided by [[Amtrak]], notable the [[Capitol Corridor]]. In addition to rail lines, there are multiple public and private ferry services (notably [[Golden Gate Ferry]] and [[Blue and Gold Fleet]]), which are being expanded by the [[San Francisco Bay Water Transit Authority]]. The regional ferry hub is San Francisco [[San Francisco Ferry Building|Ferry Building]]. AC Transit and some other agencies provide an extensive network of express "transbay" commuter buses from the suburbs to [[San Francisco Transbay Terminal]].

The freeway and highway system is very extensive; however, many freeways are heavily [[traffic congestion|congested]] during [[rush hour]], especially two of the trans-bay bridges ([[Golden Gate Bridge|Golden Gate]] and [[San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge|Bay Bridge]]). Furthermore there are some large gaps in the highways which run onto city streets in San Francisco, partially due to the [[Freeway and expressway revolts#San Francisco|Freeway Revolt]] ([[San Francisco Board of Supervisors|SF Board of Supervisors]] decisions made in 1959, 1964 and 1966), which prevented completion of freeways connecting the [[San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge]] western terminus ([[Interstate 80 in California|Interstate 80]]) with the southern terminus of the Golden Gate Bridge, and [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. 101]] through San Francisco, and additionally due to the destruction of several of those very freeway structures that sparked the revolt, which were damaged in the 1989 [[Loma Prieta earthquake]] and subsequently removed rather than being reinforced or rebuilt.

==Higher education==
The region is home to many [[colleges]] and [[seminaries]], most notably the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the [[University of California, San Francisco]] and [[Stanford University]]. In addition, the Bay Area is home to two of the twenty-eight [[Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities|Jesuit universities]] in the U.S.: [[Santa Clara University]] (founded in 1851), and [[University of San Francisco]] (1855); these are also the two oldest California colleges. [[San Jose State University]] is the founding campus of the California State University (CSU) system, and is the oldest public institution of higher education on the [[West Coast of the United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://libguides.sjsu.edu/content.php?pid=55118&sid=417049 |title=University Archives – SJSU Special Collections & Archives – SJSU Subject Guides (LibGuides) at San Jose State University Library |publisher=Libguides.sjsu.edu |date=September 22, 2011 |accessdate=November 4, 2011}}</ref> [[Saint Mary's College of California]] was founded in 1863 by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco.
