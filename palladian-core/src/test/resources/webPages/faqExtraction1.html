			Whew!  After a <b>long</b> delay, I am returning to the FAQ.  A lot of information
			has been out-of-date for some time, so I felt I had to at least get us back in place.
			<br>
			<br>
			I have noticed a growing number of sites out there that have copied all
			or part of my FAQ.  While I should be angered at what is clearly a violation
			of copyright, I'll choose to be understanding and a little flattered.
			Honestly, people, you could at least <i>mention</i> that it's my work,
			you know.  Or, you could at least link back to Cookie Central, who provides
			space for the FAQ free of charge.
			<br>
			<br>
			It's things like this, and the waning interest in the cookie issue (which
			I feel I've done my part to help), that leads me to think that this will
			be the last update to the FAQ.  I nearly pulled it down a year ago, but
			the owner of Cookie Central prevailed upon me to keep it live.
			<br>
			<br>
			In November of 1996, I wrote the very first draft of the Cookie FAQ.  It was
			a short treatise that ended up getting posted on Netscape's JavaScript newsgroup.
			The FAQ led directly to my associations with Netscape, becoming the JavaScript
			DevEdge Champion, and presenting an impromptu talk on cookies at DevCon.  Truly
			a high-point in my career.
			<br>
			<br>
			In the past five-and-a-half years, I've been able to watch cookies grow
			from a fledgling concept to the most important part of the internet
			experience.  Cookies have brought personalization, commerce, and convenience
			to the internet, legitimizing it as a place for business, not just for science
			or personal home pages.
			<br>
			<br>
			I've seen the FAQ grow as well over that time.  The first draft of the
			FAQ was written to target developers who were trying to understand
			what cookies were and how they could use them.  To this day, I see
			my examples put to use all over the internet.  But the FAQ served better
			by informing everyday people about cookies and how they really work.
			I hope I've done my part to cure the hysteria.
			<br>
			<br>
			So, I bid the FAQ good-bye.  Thanks to all of you in the past who
			have contributed ideas, feedback, questions, and complaints.  You
			all made a difference.
			<BR>
			<BR>
			And thanks for stopping by!

			<H3><A name=1>1. INTRODUCTION</A></H3>
			<P align=justify>Cookies are a very important method for maintaining
			state on the Web. "State" in this case refers to an application's
			ability to work interactively with a user, remembering all data since
			the application started, and differentiating between users and their
			individual data sets.
			<br>
			<br>
			An analogy I like to use is a laundry cleaner's shop.  You drop something
			off, and get a ticket. When you return with the ticket, you get your
			clothes back. If you don't have the ticket, then the laundry man doesn't
			know which clothes are yours.  In fact, he won't be able to tell whether
			you are there to pick up clothes, or a brand new customer.  As such,
			the ticket is critical to maintaining state between you and the laundry
			man.
			<br>
			<br>
			Unfortunately, HTTP is a "stateless" protocol.  This means that each
			visit to a site (or even clicks within a site) is seen by the server
			as the first visit by the user.  In essence, the server "forgets" everything
			after each request, unless it can somehow mark a visitor (that is,
			hand him a "laundry ticket") to help it remember.  Cookies can accomplish this.
			</P>

			<P align=justify><B><A name=1.1>1.1 What is a Cookie?</A></B>
			<BR><BR>A cookie is a text-only string that gets entered into the memory
			of your browser. This value of a variable that a website sets. If the lifetime of this value
			is set to be longer than the time you spend at that site, then this string
			is saved to file for future reference. </P>

			<P align=justify><B><A name=1.2>1.2 Where did the term cookies come from?</A></B>
			<BR><BR>According to an article written by Paul Bonner for 
			<A href="http://www.builder.com/Programming/Cookies/?st.bl.pr.10.feat.1140" rel="nofollow" target=builder.com>Builder.Com</A> on 11/18/1997: 
			<BLOCKQUOTE>
			<P align=justify>"Lou Montulli, currently the protocols manager in 
			Netscape's client product division, wrote the cookies specification for 
			Navigator 1.0, the first browser to use the technology. Montulli says 
			there's nothing particularly amusing about the origin of the name: 'A 
			cookie is a well-known computer science term that is used when 
			describing an opaque piece of data held by an intermediary. The term 
			fits the usage precisely; it's just not a well-known term outside of 
			computer science circles.'" </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

			<P align=justify><B><A name=1.3>1.3 Why do sites use Cookies?</A></B> 
			<BR><BR>There are many reasons a given site would wish to use cookies. 
			These range from the ability to personalize information (like on My Yahoo 
			or Excite), or to help with on-line sales/services (like on Amazon Books 
			or eBay), or simply for the purposes of collecting demographic information
			(like DoubleClick). Cookies also provide programmers with a quick and
			convenient means of keeping site content fresh and relevant to the user's
			interests. The newest servers use cookies to help with back-end interaction
			as well, which can improve the utility of a site by being able to securely
			store any personal data that the user has shared with a site (to help with
			quick logins on your favorite sites, for example). 
			</P>

			<P align=justify><B><A name=1.4>1.4 Where Can I Get More Information?</A></B>
			<BR><BR><A 
			href="http://www.cookiecentral.com/">Cookie Central</A> is dedicated to 
			answering questions about cookies.  Feel free to look around.
			<BR><BR>There's a great article concerning cookies on
			<a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/cookie.htm" rel="nofollow">Marshall Brain's "How Stuff Works"</a>.
			It goes even deeper than this FAQ does, especially in the realm of public opinion.  Worth a look!
			<BR><BR>The World Wide Web Consortium has an excellent 
			FAQ to answer the majority of Internet and Web-related questions. You can 
			read their topic: <A 
			href="http://www.w3.org/Security/Faq/wwwsf2.html#CLT-Q10">"Do 'Cookies' Pose 
			any Security Risks?"</A>
			<BR><BR>In addition, there are an abundance of 
			resources on the Internet that can help you find answers to your cookie 
			questions. Conveniently, <A 
			href="http://dir.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Internet/World_Wide_Web/Cookies/">Yahoo</A> 
			has a great listing of them. I encourage you to stop by and check the list 
			out!</P>

			<H3><A name=2>2. GENERAL QUESTIONS/MISCELLANEOUS</A></H3>
			<P align=justify><B><A name=2.1>2.1 Introduction</A></B> <BR><BR>This 
			section is devoted to general questions on cookies and their usage. </P>

			<P align=justify><B><A name=2.2>2.2 Can I delete cookies?</A></B> 
			<BR><BR>Yes. Whether you use Internet Explorer or Netscape, your cookies
			are saved to a simple text file that you can delete as you please.
			<BR><BR>In order to do this properly, remember to <B>close 
			your browser first</B>. This is because all your cookies are held in 
			memory until you close your browser. So, if you delete the file with your 
			browser open, it will make a new file when you close it, and your cookies 
			will be back. <BR><BR>Remember that deleting your cookie file entirely 
			will cause you to "start from scratch" with every web site you usually 
			visit. So, it may be preferable to open the cookies.txt file (in the case 
			of Netscape) and remove only the entries you don't like, or go to the 
			cookies folder (in the case of IE) and delete the files matching servers you 
			don't want. </P>

			<P align=justify><B><A name=2.3>2.3 How do I set my browser to reject 
			cookies?</A></B> <BR><BR>Both Internet Explorer and Netscape allow some
			level of cookie verification. They both have menu options that allow you
			to accept all, some, or none of your incoming cookies. In addition, the
			"warn before accepting" feature is present in both, if you want to
			screen your incoming cookies.
			<BR><BR>In Netscape, go to the <B>Edit/Preferences/Advanced</B> menu.  Your
			cookie choices can be changed there.
			<BR><BR>Microsoft has changed their approach to cookies over the last 3
			versions of their browser.  This is a reflection of how cookies have been
			thrust into the limelight of privacy on the Internet:
			<UL>
				<LI>In IE 6.0, go to the <B>Tools/Internet&nbsp;Options/Privacy</B> menu.  This menu allows you to select how discriminating the browser will be when accepting cookies, based on two factors -- (1) the source of the cookie, and (2) whether the source has a "privacy policy."  There are also features for the advanced user, if you'd like to have a greater control over cookies. <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q283185" rel="nofollow">[more info]</a>
				<LI>In IE 5.0, go to the <B>Tools/Internet&nbsp;Options/Security</B> menu.  In there, you can choose the security level for 4 different browsing conditions: Internet Sites, Local Sites, "Trusted" Sites, and Restricted Sites. If you select "Internet," and click on Custom Level, you'll get a dialog box where you can accept all, warn before accepting, or reject all cookies. <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/search/preview.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q196955" rel="nofollow">[more info]</a>
				<LI>In IE 4.0, go to the <B>View/Internet&nbsp;Options/Advanced</B> menu. There you can accept all, warn before accepting, or reject all.
			</UL>

			<BR><BR>Once a cookie is rejected, it is thrown out and not saved to
			memory or disk. Don't forget, though, that servers will keep looking
			for the cookie even if you have discarded it and may try to replace
			it as you surf around.
			
			<BR><BR>This fact is almost comical in nature. Essentially, by removing
			the way to tell the server to not send cookies, it can't remember to not
			send you any cookies the next time!</P>

			<P align=justify><B><A name=2.4>2.4 Are Cookies Dangerous to My Computer?</A></B>
			<BR><BR>NO. A cookie is a simple piece of text. It is not a program, or a plug-in.
			It cannot be used as a virus, and it cannot access your hard drive. Your browser
			(not a programmer) can save cookie values to your hard disk if it needs to, but
			that is the limit of the effect on your system. </P>

			<P align=justify><B><A name=2.5>2.5 Will cookies fill up my hard 
			drive?</A></B> <BR><BR>Both Netscape and Microsoft have measures in place 
			that limit the number of cookies that will be saved on your hard drive at 
			one time.
			<BR>
			<BR>Both Internet Explorer and Netscape conform to the RFC 2109 
			limitations on your total cookie count to 300 (this includes a limit of 20
			cookies per individual domain). If you exceed this, the browser will discard
			your least-used cookies to make room for the new ones.
			<BR>
			<BR>Microsoft saves cookies into the "Temporary 
			Internet Files" folder, a system folder that you can set the maximum size 
			of (the default is 2% of your hard drive). <BR><BR>In any event, remember 
			that most cookie files are 4KB or smaller, so you would need about a million
			cookies to fill up a 4GB drive. This is incredibly unlikely. </P>

			<P align=justify><B><A name=2.6>2.6 Are Cookies a Threat to My Privacy?</A></B>
			<BR><BR>The sad truth is that revealing any kind of personal information
			opens the door for that information to be spread.
			<BR>
			<BR>
			Consider the growing trend of technology conveniences in our lives.
			We use "frequent buyer" cards at supermarkets and gas stations.  We
			place electronic tags on our cars to pay tolls faster and easier.
			We let banks pay our bills for us automatically each month without
			checks.
			<br>
			<br>
			While each of these technologies (and others like them) have made our
			lives more convenient, each time we use them exposes us to a loss of
			privacy.  Stores know what foods you eat.  Gas stations know how much
			you spend on gas per fill-up.  Turnpike operators know how fast you
			drive on their highways.  Banks know how you spend your money each
			month.
			<BR>
			<BR>
			It's the same with cookies.  In fact, one may argue that cookies in the
			long-run will be less damaging to privacy efforts than those technologies
			described above.  If you're going to single-out cookies as your sole
			vulnerability to personal privacy, you should re-examine how you live
			your daily life.
			<BR>
			<BR>
			The never-ending ethical debate associated with these facts shall be
			left to other forums. However, it is wise to consider carefully the
			information you collect and share over the Internet. </P>

			<P align=justify><B><A name=2.7>2.7 Sites are telling me I need to turn on 
			cookies, but they <I>are</I> on. What's wrong?</A></B>
			<BR><BR>There are 
			three likely possibilities for problems like this. Firstly, the site you 
			are visiting may be detecting cookies improperly. As a result, it may 
			appear to the site that you are rejecting cookies when in fact you are 
			not.
			<BR><BR>Another possibility is that you may be running software that 
			interferes with cookie usage. There are many filtering and blocking 
			software packages available for Internet users these days, and many of 
			them also filter cookies. If you are running software like this, then your 
			computer may not receive or send cookies. This will cause sites you visit 
			to assume you are not accepting cookies.
			<BR><BR>Finally, your machine may 
			be behind a firewall or proxy server that prevents cookie transmission. 
			This is most likely in a corporate environment. So, regardless of how your 
			browser is set, cookies won't be sent or received by your browser. Since 
			the cookies aren't making it through to your browser, the Web Site will 
			assume you personally aren't accepting them. </P>

			<P align=justify><B><A name=2.8>2.8 I deleted my cookies, and I can't 
			log-on to my favorite site anymore. What can I do?</A></B>
			<BR><BR>Many 
			sites use a cookie to keep track of your settings on their servers, and to 
			help you log in to their site. If you lose your cookie, that site cannot 
			recall your settings for you to use.
			<BR><BR>If this happens to you, the 
			best thing you can do is contact that site's webmaster or customer service 
			department. </P>

			<P align=justify><B><A name=2.9>2.9 How did I get a cookie from 
			doubleclick? I've never been there!</A></B> <BR><BR>In <A 
			href="#3.3">section 3.3</A>, we'll see that 
			a server cannot set a cookie for a domain that it isn't a member of. 
			However, almost every Web user has gotten a cookie from 
			"ad.doubleclick.net" at one time or another, without ever visiting there. 
			DoubleClick and other advertisers have employed a clever solution that 
			enables them to track users and serve media content without violating this 
			rule. <BR><BR>Most sites on the Internet do not keep their advertisements 
			locally. Rather, they subscribe to a media service that places those ads 
			for them. This is accomplished via a simple HTML call to the media 
			service. When a page is requested, it is assembled through many HTTP 
			requests by the browser. First, there is a request for the HTML itself. 
			Then, everything the HTML needs is requested, including images, sounds, 
			and plug-ins. <BR><BR>The call to the media service is an HTTP request for 
			an image. Once the request is made to the media service, it can return 
			more than just an ad. It can also return a cookie. Or, if is has given the 
			user a cookie previously, it can read that first, and check to see what ad 
			to send. The net result is that the user gets a cookie from the media 
			service without ever having visited it. <BR><BR>This usage of cookies is 
			the most controversial, and has led to the polarized opinions on cookies, 
			privacy, and the Internet. </P>

			<P align=justify><B><A name=2.10>2.10 I looked at my Internet Explorer 
			cookies, and they had my <I>username</I> on them! Can servers see my 
			username?</A></B> <BR><BR>Because Windows systems allow more than one user 
			to login and use programs, Microsoft had to come up with a way to keep 
			each user's cookies separate on a given machine. This can be common in 
			workplaces, where a single machine is shared by many employees. 
			<BR><BR>This is accomplished by appending the username to the cookie file 
			name. This way, both Jane Doe and Joe Smith can get cookies from 
			coolsite.com and they don't get over-written. Also, this stop's Jane from 
			using Joe's cookies while she's surfing, since the browser will only use 
			her cookies when she is logged in. That is, the cookie file: 
			<BR><BR></FONT><I>
			
<PRE>jdoe@coolsite.txt</PRE>

			</I><P align=justify><FONT face=Verdana,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>Contains Jane 
			Doe's cookie for coolsite.com. If anyone else logs-in, then this cookie is 
			not used. <BR><BR>This is the only reason that the username is part of the 
			cookie file name. The username does <B>not</B> get sent to the server with 
			the cookie data. </P>
			
			<P align=justify><B><A name=2.11>2.11 There are two extra files in
			my Cookies folder called Mm256.dat and Mm2048.dat.  What are they?</A></B>
			<BR>

			work?</A></B> <BR><BR>Understanding how cookies really work requires an 
			understanding of how HTTP works. Cookies transport from Server to Client 
			and back as an HTTP header. The specifications for this header are 
			explicitly laid out in <A 
			href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/htbin/rfc/rfc2109.html">RFC 2109</A>. 
			<BR><BR>When a cookie is sent from the server to the browser, an 
			additional line is added to the HTTP headers (example): <BR><BR></FONT><I>
<PRE>
Content-type: text/html
Set-Cookie: foo=bar; path=/; expires Mon, 09-Dec-2002 13:46:00 GMT
</PRE>
			</I><P align=justify><FONT face=Verdana,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>This header 
			entry would result in a cookie named <B>foo</B>. The value of <B>foo</B> 
			is <B>bar</B>. In addition, this cookie has a path of <B>/</B>, meaning 
			that it is valid for the entire site, and it has an expiration date of 
			<B>Dec 9, 2002 at 1:46pm Greenwich Mean Time (or Universal Time)</B>. 
			Provided the browser can understand this header, the cookie will be set. 
			<BR><BR>When a cookie is sent from the browser to the server, the cookie 
			header is changed slightly: </FONT><BR><BR><I>
<PRE>
Content-type: text/html
Cookie: foo=bar
</PRE>
			</I><FONT face=Verdana,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>
			<P align=justify>Here, the server is made aware of a cookie called 
			<B>foo</B>, whose value is <B>bar</B>. </P>


			<P align=justify><B><A name=3.3>3.3 Breakdown of Cookie Parameters</A></B> 
			<BR><BR>As we have just seen, a cookie contains more than simply a name 
			and a value. In fact, a cookie has 6 parameters that can be passed to it: 
			<UL>
			<LI>The <B>name</B> of the cookie, 
			<LI>The <B>value</B> of the cookie, 
			<LI>The <B>expiration date</B> of the cookie, 
			<LI>The <B>path</B> the cookie is valid for, 
			<LI>The <B>domain</B> the cookie is valid for, 
			<LI>The need for a <B>secure</B> connection to exist to use the cookie. 
			</LI></UL>
			<P align=justify>Two of these are mandatory (its name and its value). The 
			other four can be set manually or automatically. Each parameter is 
			separated by a semicolon when set explicitly. Here is a detailed 
			description of each. <BR><BR><B><I>Name, Value</I></B> <BR><BR>The name of 
			a cookie and its value are set simply by pairing them together: 
			</FONT><BR><BR><I>
			
<PRE>... foo=bar ...</PRE>
			
			</I><FONT face=Verdana,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>The value of a cookie 
			can also be null, for the purpose of clearing the cookie value: 
			</FONT><BR><BR><I>
			
<PRE>... foo= ...</PRE>
			
			</I><P align=justify><FONT face=Verdana,Arial,Helvetica 
			size=-1><B><I>Expires</I></B> <BR><BR>The expires parameter lets you 
			determine the lifetime of the cookie.</FONT> <BR><BR><I>
			
<PRE>... expires=Mon, 01-Jan-2001 00:00:00 GMT ...</PRE>

			</I><P align=justify><FONT face=Verdana,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>If 
			<I>Expires</I> is not set explicitly, then it defaults to end-of-session. 
			The length of a session can vary depending on browsers and servers, but 
			generally a session is the length of time that the browser is open for 
			(even if the user is no longer at that site). <BR><BR><B><I>Path</I></B> 
			<BR><BR>The path parameter is potentially the most useful of the 4 
			optional cookie settings. It sets the URL path the cookie is valid within. 
			Pages outside of that path cannot read or use the cookie. 
			<BR><BR></FONT><I>
			
<PRE>... path=/promo ...</PRE>
			
			</I><P align=justify><FONT face=Verdana,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>If <I>Path</I> 
			is not set explicitly, then it defaults to the URL path of the document 
			creating the cookie. <BR><BR>Netscape has identified a bug for VERY old 
			versions of Navigator where the path <B>must</B> be specified if an 
			expiration is specified. Furthermore, this path must be set to "/". For 
			more information, browse Netscape's Cookie Spec at: <BR><A 
			href="http://www.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html" 
			target="Resource Window">http://www.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html</A> 
			<BR><BR><B><I>Domain</I></B> <BR><BR>The domain parameter takes the 
			flexibility of the path parameter one step further. If a site uses 
			multiple servers within a domain the it is important to make the cookie 
			accessible to pages on any of these servers. <BR><BR></FONT><I>
			
<PRE>... domain=www.myserver.com ...</PRE>
			
			</I><P align=justify><FONT face=Verdana,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>Cookies can be 
			assigned to individual machines, or to an entire Internet domain. The only 
			restrictions on this value is that it must contain at least two dots 
			(.myserver.com, <B>not</B> myserver.com) for the normal top-level domains, 
			or three dots for the "extended" domains (.myserver.ny.us, <B>not</B> 
			myserver.ny.us) <BR><BR><B>IMPORTANT:</B> The server issuing the cookie 
			must be a member of the domain that it tries to set in the cookie. That 
			is, a server called www.myserver.com cannot set a cookie for the domain 
			www.yourserver.com. The security implications should be obvious. 
			<BR><BR>If <I>Domain</I> is not set explicitly, then it defaults to the 
			full domain of the document creating the cookie. 
			<BR><BR><B><I>Secure</I></B> <BR><BR>The secure parameter is a flag 
			indicating that a cookie should only be used under a secure server 
			condition, such as SSL. Since most sites do not require secure 
			connections, this defaults to FALSE. </P>


			<P align=justify><B><A name=3.4>3.4 How do cookies end up on my hard 
			drive?</A></B> <BR><BR>After a cookie is transmitted through an HTTP 
			header, it is stored in the memory of your browser. This way the 
			information is quickly and readily available without re-transmission. As 
			we have seen, however, it is possible for the lifetime of a cookie to 
			greatly exceed the amount of time the browser will be open. <BR><BR>In 
			such cases, the browser must have a way of saving the cookie when you are 
			not browsing, or when your computer is shut off. The only way the browser 
			can do this is to move the cookies from memory into the hard drive. This way, 
			when you start your browser a few days later, you still have the cookies 
			you had previously. <BR><BR>The browser is constantly performing 
			maintenance on its cookies. Every time you open your browser, your cookies 
			are read in from disk, and every time you close your browser, your cookies 
			are re-saved to disk. As a cookie expires, it is discarded from memory and 
			it is no longer saved to the hard drive. </P>

			<P align=justify><B><A name=3.5>3.5 What are all those entries in my 
			cookies.txt file?</A></B> <BR><BR>The layout of Netscape's 
			<I>cookies.txt</I> file is such that each line contains one name-value 
			pair. An example cookies.txt file may have an entry that looks like this: 
			</FONT>
			
<PRE>.netscape.com     TRUE   /  FALSE  946684799   NETSCAPE_ID  100103</PRE>
			
			<P align=justify><FONT face=Verdana,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>Each line 
			represents a single piece of stored information. A tab is inserted between 
			each of the fields. <BR><BR>From left-to-right, here is what each field 
			represents: <BR><BR><B>domain</B> - The domain that created AND that can 
			read the variable. <BR><B>flag</B> - A TRUE/FALSE value indicating if all 
			machines within a given domain can access the variable. This value is set 
			automatically by the browser, depending on the value you set for 
			<B>domain</B>. <BR><B>path</B> - The path within the domain that the 
			variable is valid for. <BR><B>secure</B> - A TRUE/FALSE value indicating 
			if a secure connection with the domain is needed to access the variable. 
			<BR><B>expiration</B> - The UNIX time that the variable will expire on. 
			UNIX time is defined as the number of seconds since Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 
			GMT. <BR><B>name</B> - The name of the variable. <BR><B>value</B> - The 
			value of the variable. </P>

			<P align=justify><B><A name=3.6>3.6 Where does MSIE keep its

			locations, depending on the version of explorer and Windows you are using.
			The best way to find it is to use the Windows "Search" feature an look
			for the "Cookies" folder.  More information can be found <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q153417" rel="nofollow">here</a>.
			<br>
			<br>
			Although the location may be different, the format is the same. Each individual
			domain's cookies are stored in their own file, along with the username that
			accessed the site.  For example, if I went to Yahoo.com, I would get a cookie
			that is stored in the file <B>dwhalen@yahoo.txt</B>. <BR><BR>Note that the 
			username is <I>not</I> sent with the cookie. See <A 
			href="#2.10">Section 2.10</A> for more

			<P align=justify><B><A name=3.7>3.7 Are cookies Year 2000 Compliant?</A></B>
			<BR><BR>There is no date-specific restriction on the 
			HTTP header used to transmit cookies. In fact, the only determining factor

			this. Cookies with expiration dates set with 2-digit or 4-digit years are

			<B><A name=4>4. ADVANCED TOPICS</A></B> 
			<P align=justify><B><A name=4.1>4.1 Introduction</A></B> <BR><BR>This 
			section covers topics beyond those discussed above. 
			</P>
			
			<P align=justify><B><A name=4.2>4.2 Creating a Cookie Value</A></B>
			<BR><BR>
			Creating a cookie generally involves duplicating the HTTP cookie header in some 
			fashion so that the browser will store the name-value pair in memory. Some 
			languages expect an exact HTTP header to be sent, while others will use 
			built-in functions to help you speed the process along.
			<BR><BR>
			Cookies can be set from the browser-side or from the server-side. The determining 
			factor will be the language you use to create the cookie. Once the cookie 
			is created, it should flow easily from server to client and back via the 
			HTTP headers.
			<br>
			<br>
			There are limits on the contents of both the cookie string and the
			cookie file. These limits are partially imposed by HTTP and partially
			by arbitrary choice. They are as follows:
			<OL>
				<LI>You CANNOT set Cookies for domains other than those that your
				response originates from. That is, a page on www.myserver.com can set a 
				Cookie for myserver.com and www.myserver.com, but NOT www.yourserver.com. 
				<LI>The cookie HTTP header must be no more than 4K in size. 
			</OL>
			<P align=justify>Note that this applies to cookies while they are in 
			memory or stored in the cookies.txt file.</P>

			<P align=justify><B><A name=4.3>4.3 Retrieving a Cookie Value</A></B>
			<BR><BR>
			For the most part, retrieving cookies does not require reading the HTTP Cookie: 
			header. Most languages read this header for you and make it accessible 
			through a variable or object. <BR><BR>Cookies can be read on the browser 
			side or the server side. Again, the determining factor is the language 
			used.
			<br>
			<br>
			The main limit on retrieving a cookie is that you can only 
			retrieve cookies that are valid for the document your script resides in. 
			That is, a script on www.myserver.com cannot read cookies from 
			www.yourserver.com. This is also true for subdirectories within your site.
			A cookie valid for /dirOne cannot be read by a script in /dirTwo.  This
			is mainly governed on the browser side, as browsers know the URL that
			they are accessing, and only transmit cookies for that server across
			the connection.</P>
			
			<P align=justify><B><A name=4.4>4.4 Clearing a Cookie Value</A></B> 
			<BR><BR>When programming a Web site, there are many reasons that you may 
			need to erase a cookie you have created. Often it is because the cookie is 
			no longer needed, or the scheme of your cookie has been altered, and 
			requires resetting. <BR><BR>The two main steps to clearing a cookie you 
			have created are: 
			<OL>
			<LI>Set the cookie's value to null. 
			<LI>Set the cookie's expiration date to some time in the past. 
			</OL>
			<P align=justify>The reason you must do both is that simply setting the 
			expiration to a past time will not change it's value until the browser is 
			closed. That is, all cookie names, values, expirations, etc are resolved 
			once the browser program has been closed. Setting the cookie to null 
			allows you to properly test for the cookie until that resolution. </P>

			<P align=justify><B><A name=4.5>4.5 Detecting if cookies are 
			accepted</A></B> <BR><BR>To properly detect if a cookie is being accepted 
			via the server, the cookie needs to be set on one HTTP request and read 
			back in another. This cannot be accomplished within 1 request. When using 
			PERL or ASP, try to funnel your visitors through a common page where you 
			can set a test cookie. Then, when the time comes to detect, check for that 
			cookie. <BR><BR>If you use client-side languages to set a cookie, you can 
			set and read on the same page. Cookies set by JavaScript or VBScript 
			reside in the browser's memory already, so you will know if they have been 
			accepted right away. Check by setting a test value, and then try to read 
			that value back out of the cookie. If the value still exists, the cookie 
			was accepted. </P>

			<P align=justify><B><A name=4.6>4.6 Compact Privacy Policies and IE6</A></B>
			<br>
			<br>
			In 1998, the W3C started drafting a proposal for a Platform for
			Privacy Preferences (P3P).  P3P has 3 main goals (courtesy of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/P3P/" rel="nofollow">W3C</a>):
			<ul>
			<li>To inform a user agent of a site's data collection and privacy practices. 
			<li>To allow a user agent and service to automatically negotiate and to come to an agreement satisfactory to both parties; alternatively, for the user agent to notify the user and take instruction concerning proposed data exchanges from the user. 
			<li>To exchange data when such exchange is authorized by the user and consistent with a user's preferences and any outstanding agreement. 
			</ul>
			<p align=Justify>
			Now an official specification, P3Ps use an XML file to describe in as
			much detail as possible how a web site uses personal data during and
			after a user's session.  This can include the intended usage of cookies
			to hold or refer to such information.
			<br>
			<br>
			Alternatively, a site can create a P3P policy that refers solely to
			its cookie use.  These Compact Privacy Policies are a focal point in
			Microsoft's new strategy in addressing the cookie "problem."
			<br>
			<br>
			Users of Internet Explorer 6 can set their Privacy preferences based
			upon whether the target site has a Privacy Policy or not.  If a site
			does not have a policy, its cookies may be automatically rejected by
			IE, and the user will see an icon on the status bar indicating a conflict
			with the user's privacy preferences.
			<br>
			<br>
			P3P may have a broad impact on cookies and their future use.  Especially
			in the context of advertising and commerce.  Even though compact policies
			are essentially straightforward to create, users still stand to regain a
			great deal of control over their browser's communications.
