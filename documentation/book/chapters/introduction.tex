\chapter{Introduction}
Internet Information Retrieval (IIR) is a research domain in computer science concerned with the retrieval, extraction, classification, and presentation of information from the Internet. The toolkit provides functionality which is often needed to perform IIR tasks such as crawling, classification, and extraction of various types of information.

\section{What Palladian is}
%TODO contributions
Palladian is a collection of algorithms for text processing focused on \textbf{ classification}, \textbf{ extraction}, and \textbf{ retrieval}. The concept of Palladian is system to reuse algorithms that are freely available and build upon them to drive research. When trying to learn and advance in a new field of research, one has to play around with many code snippets from various authors, this toolkit tries to ease this process by making external libraries accessible through a single interface. This way new algorithms can be quickly compared to the state-of-the-art.
The best results from students at the Dresden University of Technology find their way into the toolkit allowing other users to create more advanced programs in the future.

Our main contributions to the research community are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item New algorithms in the fields of classification and extraction that can easily be tested and applied to other projects.
\item Single interface access to bundles of well established algorithms.
\item Helping make research more transparent by fomenting users to reproduce results with the included algorithms.
\end{enumerate}

Figure \ref{fig:architecture} shows the main packages of Palladian. The focus is evidently on retrieval (Crawler, API access, feed reading...), preprocessing (tokenization, sentence splitting...), classification (KNN, Dictionary Classifier...), and extraction (named entities, tags...).

\section{What Palladian is NOT}
Palladian is not a full natural language processing suite nor does it contain a \textit{ full} set of algorithms in the fields of classification, extraction, and information retrieval. Palladian is not a commercial product either, we like to answer questions as soon and comprehensive as possible but cannot guarantee this support.

\section{Who the Intended User is}
In general everybody is welcome to use Palladian, but the researchers that would develop algorithms and would like to quickly test or compare them are the focus. Researchers likely to help other researchers, that won't mind a software that is not perfect, bug-free or commercial.

\section{Evaluation Measures for IIR Systems}

This sections outlines important evaluation measures which are typically used for comparing and scoring algorithms and techniques in (Internet) Information Retrieval. Our goal is to give just a brief overview, more details can be found in the referenced literature.

\subsection{Precision, Recall, and F-measure} \label{sec:Introduction:PrRcF1}

Considering a specific query (e.\,g. \textit{apples OR oranges}), a set of relevant and non-relevant documents and a subset of retrieved -- i.\,e. found -- documents, we can distinguish between four disjoint sets, which can be classified as combinations of the attributes ``true'' or ``false'' with ``positive'' or ``negative'', as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:PrecisionRecall}. Documents which have been filtered out by the system errnously are classified as ``false negatives'', irrelevant documents which are presented to the user are classified as ``false positives''. Precision $P$ and Recall $R$ can be determined as stated in Equations~\ref{eqn:Precision} and \ref{eqn:Recall}. Intuitively, both take a range between 0 and 1 inclusively, where 1 denotes the optimum.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:Precision}
	Precision = P = \frac{\left|\,\mathit{relevant, retrieved docs}\,\right|}{\left|\,\mathit{retrieved docs}\,\right|} = \frac{\left|\,\mathit{true positives}\,\right|}{\left|\,\mathit{true positives}\,\right| + \left|\,\mathit{false positives}\,\right|}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}	
	\label{eqn:Recall}
	Recall = R = \frac{\left|\,\mathit{relevant, retrieved docs}\,\right|}{\left|\,\mathit{relevant docs}\,\right|} = \frac{\left|\,\mathit{true positives}\,\right|}{\left|\,\mathit{true positives}\,\right| + \left|\,\mathit{false negatives}\,\right|}
\end{equation}

The F-measure combines both the Precsion and the Recall to one value. Usually the so called $F_1$ score is calculated by employing a harmonic mean as depicted in Equation~\ref{eqn:F1Measure}. The universal F-measure which allows weighting, and thus prioritizing, Precision and Recall values differently is described in \cite[p.\,156]{Manning:2009}. 

\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:F1Measure}
	F_1 = \frac{2 \cdot P \cdot R}{P + R}
\end{equation}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error}

The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used for measuring the deviation of estimated or predicted numeric values from their actual values. Therefor, the average of the quadratic differences between each actual value $y$ and the predicted value $\bar y$ is calculated. By squaring down the differences, the bigger errors are weighted stronger compared to small errors. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) additionally extracts the square root from the MSE, as depicted in Equation~\ref{eqn:RMSE}.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:RMSE}
	\mathit{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar y_i)^2}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Precision at k, Average Precision, Mean Average Precision}

Precision, Recall and F-measure as described in Section~\ref{sec:Introduction:PrRcF1} are metrics, which only consider unsorted sets of items. To evaluate ordered lists, which are ranked by relevance for example, the following measures can be employed.

``Precision at k'' denotes the precision for a ranked sublist of the first k documents as illustrated in Equation~\ref{eqn:PrAtK}. The binary function $rel(i)$ takes a value of 1, if the document at position $i$ is relevant for the current query, 0 elsewise \cite{Mahesh:1999}. For example, $P(k = 10)$ with 5 relevant and 5 irrelevant documents results in a value of 0.5.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:PrAtK}
	P(k) = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{k} \mathit{rel}(i)}{k}
\end{equation}

Equation~\ref{eqn:AP} shows the Average Precision (AP), which is the sum of the precisions from Equation~\ref{eqn:PrAtK} where $rel(i)$ equals a value of 1, divided by the total count of relevant documents in the sublist of $n$ results \cite{Mahesh:1999}. Table~\ref{tab:ExampleMAP} gives a calculation example.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:AP}
	\mathit{AP} = \frac{\sum_{k = 1}^{n} P(k) \mathit{rel}(k)}{R}
\end{equation}

Some functionalities of this toolkit are covered in other libraries. If you can't find the functionality you need in Palladian you might want to take a look at these alternatives. Some of the objectives of Palladian are to create new functionalities or improve existing ones, not to reinvent the wheel and redo work that functions well in other libraries.
