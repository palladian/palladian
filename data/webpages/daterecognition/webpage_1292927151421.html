  <H1>Chapter 7-2: General Provisions</H1>
  <P class=sec2nos><A id=section7_2_1 name=section7_2_1></A>7-2-1 Legislative Intent.<!--htdig_noindex--><a href="#main"><img src="../images/totop.gif" alt="Go to the top" width="32" height="13" border="0" align="absbottom" /></a><!--/htdig_noindex--></P>
<P>The purpose of this title is to protect the health, safety, welfare, and convenience of the public by regulating the movement and stopping of pedestrians and ridden or herded animals on streets and the equipment, movement, stopping, parking, storage, and towing of vehicles.</P>
<P class=sec2nos><A id=section7_2_2 name=section7_2_2></A>7-2-2 Short Title.<!--htdig_noindex--><a href="#main"><img src="../images/totop.gif" alt="Go to the top" width="32" height="13" border="0" align="absbottom" /></a><!--/htdig_noindex--></P>
<P>This title may be referred to as the "Boulder Traffic Ordinance."</P>
<P class=sec2nos><A id=section7_2_3 name=section7_2_3></A>7-2-3 Application of Title.<!--htdig_noindex--><a href="#main"><img src="../images/totop.gif" alt="Go to the top" width="32" height="13" border="0" align="absbottom" /></a><!--/htdig_noindex--></P>
<P>(a) Regulation of vehicles under this title applies everywhere to the maximum extent of the jurisdiction of the city, except for those provisions, sections, or chapters that by their terms apply only to certain areas.</P>
<P>(b) Regulation of pedestrians and ridden or herded animals under this title applies to streets, including, without limitation, sidewalks and sidewalk areas.</P>
<P class=sec2nos><A id=section7_2_4 name=section7_2_4></A>7-2-4 Penalties.<!--htdig_noindex--><a href="#main"><img src="../images/totop.gif" alt="Go to the top" width="32" height="13" border="0" align="absbottom" /></a><!--/htdig_noindex--></P>
<P>(a) Violations of any of the provisions of those sections of this title for which no specific penalty has been provided are traffic infractions. Every person who is convicted of a traffic infraction, who admits liability for a traffic infraction, or against whom a judgment is entered for a traffic infraction is subject to a fine or penalty of at least $10.00 but not more than $500.00.</P>
<P>(b) The minimum and maximum fine or monetary penalty for any moving traffic infraction committed in a school zone shall be double that otherwise provided in this section, but not to exceed $500.00. If the school zone was also a construction zone for which speeding fines are doubled, and the person is convicted of, admits liability for, or against whom a judgment is entered for both a speeding infraction and some other moving traffic infraction, only the fine for the speeding infraction shall be doubled.</P>
<P>(Ordinance Nos. 6033 (1998); 7409 (2005))</P>
<P class=sec2nos><A id=section7_2_5 name=section7_2_5></A>7-2-5 Overlapping Prohibitions.<!--htdig_noindex--><a href="#main"><img src="../images/totop.gif" alt="Go to the top" width="32" height="13" border="0" align="absbottom" /></a><!--/htdig_noindex--></P>
<P>Certain traffic misconduct is prohibited under more than one section of this title. The fact that the section a defendant is charged with violating is less specific, carries a greater maximum penalty, or carries greater collateral consequences than some other section is not a basis for dismissal or acquittal as long as the elements of the section cited are proven. If the judge finds that the sole basis for the finding of guilt of or liability for a more general charge, one that carries a greater maximum penalty, or one that carries greater penalty point collateral consequences against the driving privilege under the statutes of the state was conduct that satisfied the elements of the other charge and no more, the sentence may not exceed the maximum applicable to the other charge, and upon application of a convicted defendant at the time of sentencing, the judge shall amend the judgment to reflect the other charge. Inattentive driving and reckless driving are never "other" charges within the meaning of this section, nor is paragraph <a href="chapter7-4.htm#section7_4_58">7-4-58</a>(b)(4), B.R.C. 1981, such an other charge of paragraph <a href="chapter7-4.htm#section7_4_56">7-4-56</a>(a)(2), B.R.C. 1981.</P>
<P>(Ordinance No. 7424 (2005))</P>
<P class=sec2nos><A id=section7_2_6 name=section7_2_6></A>7-2-6 Necessity.<!--htdig_noindex--><a href="#main"><img src="../images/totop.gif" alt="Go to the top" width="32" height="13" border="0" align="absbottom" /></a><!--/htdig_noindex--></P>
<P>(a) Conduct that would otherwise constitute a violation of this title is justifiable and not a violation when:</P>
<P class="paraindent1">(1) It is a reasonable emergency response compelled by the necessity of avoiding an imminent traffic hazard that is about to occur by reason of a traffic situation occasioned or developed through no misconduct, fault, or omission of the driver;</P>
<P class="paraindent1">(2) The driver had been obeying all relevant traffic laws prior to the time such driver discovered or reasonably should have discovered the hazard; and</P>
<P class="paraindent1">(3) The hazard was of sufficient gravity that, according to all ordinary standards of careful driving, the desirability and urgency of avoiding the hazard through violating the traffic law by the means employed clearly outweigh the desirability of avoiding the hazard through lawful driving alternatives.</P>
<P>(b) Before evidence relating to a defense under this section is presented to a jury, the defendant shall first make a detailed offer of proof to the judge, who shall rule as a matter of law whether the claimed facts or circumstances would, if established, establish the defense. If the judge admits such evidence, the judge shall again rule as a matter of law on the sufficiency of the evidence that if believed by the jury would establish the defense.</P>
<P>(c) A defense under this section is a specific defense.</P>
<P class=sec2nos><A id=section7_2_7 name=section7_2_7></A>7-2-7 Mechanical Failure No Defense.<!--htdig_noindex--><a href="#main"><img src="../images/totop.gif" alt="Go to the top" width="32" height="13" border="0" align="absbottom" /></a><!--/htdig_noindex--></P>
<P>The driver of a vehicle has a responsibility to the public to guarantee that the vehicle is at all times in proper mechanical condition so that the driver is able to steer, start, proceed, stop, signal, see, and be seen properly, and otherwise to comply with the traffic law. Consequently, mechanical failure, however unexpected, is no defense to a charge of violation of this title except insofar as it serves to negate a reckless, knowing, or intentional mental state where such is an element of the violation.</P>
<P class=sec2nos><A id=section7_2_8 name=section7_2_8></A>7-2-8 Bicycle School for Children.<!--htdig_noindex--><a href="#main"><img src="../images/totop.gif" alt="Go to the top" width="32" height="13" border="0" align="absbottom" /></a><!--/htdig_noindex--></P>
<P>Before the judge accepts a plea from a child under the age of sixteen years for a bicycle infraction, the judge shall afford the child a reasonable opportunity to attend a free bicycle safety class, and if the child attends such class, the judge shall dismiss the charge unless the judge finds that dismissal is not in the best interests of the child.</P>
<P class=sec2nos><A id=section7_2_9 name=section7_2_9></A>7-2-9 Driving, Stopping, or Parking in Space.<!--htdig_noindex--><a href="#main"><img src="../images/totop.gif" alt="Go to the top" width="32" height="13" border="0" align="absbottom" /></a><!--/htdig_noindex--></P>
<P>If any provision of this title prohibits driving, stopping, or parking a vehicle in any space, a violation occurs if any part of the vehicle is in such space. If any provision of this title requires that driving, stopping, or parking occur within any space, a violation occurs if any part of the vehicle is not in such space.</P>
<P class=sec2nos><A id=section7_2_10 name=section7_2_10></A>7-2-10 Traffic Control Device Required.<!--htdig_noindex--><a href="#main"><img src="../images/totop.gif" alt="Go to the top" width="32" height="13" border="0" align="absbottom" /></a><!--/htdig_noindex--></P>
<P>(a) Every provision of this title for which a traffic control device is required shall be enforced against an alleged violator if, at the time and place of the alleged violation, the device was of the proper type, in proper position, sufficiently legible to be seen by an ordinarily observant person, and placed by a public authority. Whenever a particular section does not state that a device is required, such section is effective even though no device was in place.</P>
<P>(b) Any traffic control device placed in substantial compliance with the position required by the state traffic control manual is in proper position. Where no position is required, any position recommended by the state traffic control manual and any other reasonable position is a proper position.</P>
<P>(c) Every traffic control device on a street or other land in which a public authority has an interest shall be presumed to be an official traffic control device of proper type and in proper position and sufficiently legible to be seen by an ordinarily observant person and placed by a public authority unless the contrary is established by a preponderance of credible evidence.</P>
<P>(d) Every traffic control device alongside of or on a sidewalk or path intended to regulate bicycle, pedestrian or any other traffic thereon is in proper position and of the proper type if, at the time and place of the alleged violation, it was in a reasonable position, its command was clear, it was sufficiently legible to be seen by an ordinarily observant person, and it was placed by a public authority.</P>
<P>(Ordinance No. 5241 (1989))</P>
<P class=sec2nos><A id=section7_2_11 name=section7_2_11></A>7-2-11 Public Employees to Obey Traffic Regulations.<!--htdig_noindex--><a href="#main"><img src="../images/totop.gif" alt="Go to the top" width="32" height="13" border="0" align="absbottom" /></a><!--/htdig_noindex--></P>
<P>The provisions of this title apply to all persons regardless of their public or private employment or the public or private ownership of any vehicle involved, subject only to any specific exceptions set forth in this title.</P>
<P class=sec2nos><A id=section7_2_12 name=section7_2_12></A>7-2-12 Exemptions for Authorized Emergency Vehicles.<!--htdig_noindex--><a href="#main"><img src="../images/totop.gif" alt="Go to the top" width="32" height="13" border="0" align="absbottom" /></a><!--/htdig_noindex--></P>
<P>(a) The driver of an authorized emergency vehicle, while responding to an emergency call, while in pursuit of an actual or suspected violator of the law, or while responding to but not returning from a fire alarm may exercise the privileges set forth in this section. The driver of any authorized emergency vehicle may:</P>
<P class="paraindent1">(1) Park or stop, irrespective of the provisions of this title;</P>
<P class="paraindent1">(2) Proceed past a red or stop traffic control signal or sign, but only after slowing down as may be necessary for reasonably safe operation;</P>
<P class="paraindent1">(3) Exceed a speed limit so long as life or property is not unreasonably endangered thereby; and</P>
<P class="paraindent1">(4) Disregard regulations governing direction of movement, turning in specified directions, or driving in a particular place.</P>
<P>(b) The provisions of this section and <a href="#section7_2_13">section 7-2-13</a>, "Exemptions for Maintenance Vehicles," B.R.C. 1981, do not relieve the privileged driver of the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons, nor do such provisions protect the driver from the consequences of such driver's reckless disregard for the safety of others.</P>
<P>(c) The exemptions granted in this section apply only while the authorized emergency vehicle, other than a bicycle, is making use of audible or visible signals meeting the requirements of section 42-4-213 or 42-4-222, C.R.S., as amended. But an authorized emergency vehicle being operated as a police vehicle while in actual pursuit of a suspected violator of any provision of this title need not display or make use of audible or visual signals as long as such pursuit is being made to obtain verification of or evidence of the guilt of the suspected violator. Where paragraph (a)(1) of this section is concerned, only such lights or other measures need to be taken as are reasonably necessary to warn of the special hazard, if any, presented by such parking or stopping.</P>
<P>(Ordinance Nos. 5848 (1996); 5920 (1997))</P>
<P class=sec2nos><A id=section7_2_13 name=section7_2_13></A>7-2-13 Exemptions for Maintenance Vehicles.<!--htdig_noindex--><a href="#main"><img src="../images/totop.gif" alt="Go to the top" width="32" height="13" border="0" align="absbottom" /></a><!--/htdig_noindex--></P>
<P>Drivers of authorized service vehicles and vehicles engaged in the construction or maintenance of public streets or traffic control devices or authorized to work in the right-of-way under <a href="chapter4-18.htm">chapter 4-18</a>, "Street, Sidewalk, and Public Property Use Permits," B.R.C. 1981, may, when and where reasonably necessary for such purposes, disregard the provisions of this title concerning parking and stopping, driving too slowly, direction of movement, turning in specified directions, lane usage, and similar provisions as long as life or property is not unreasonably endangered thereby.</P>
<P class=sec2nos><A id=section7_2_14 name=section7_2_14></A>7-2-14 Permit Required for Parades, Processions, and Sound Trucks.<!--htdig_noindex--><a href="#main"><img src="../images/totop.gif" alt="Go to the top" width="32" height="13" border="0" align="absbottom" /></a><!--/htdig_noindex--></P>
<P>(a) No person in a funeral or other procession or a parade, except the military, police, or fire forces of the city, the state, or the United States, shall occupy, march, drive, or proceed upon or along any street except in accordance with a permit issued under this section.</P>
<P>(b) No sound truck or other vehicle equipped with an amplifier or loudspeaker shall use such equipment while upon a street for the purpose of selling, offering for sale, or advertising in any fashion except in accordance with a permit issued under this section.</P>
<P>(c) Upon application the city manager shall issue a funeral, procession, parade, or sound truck permit if the manager finds that:</P>
<P class="paraindent1">(1) Such activity will not violate <a href="chapter5-9.htm">chapter 5-9</a>, "Noise," B.R.C. 1981;</P>
<P class="paraindent1">(2) There is no reason to believe that such activity cannot be carried out in safety;</P>
<P class="paraindent1">(3) Such activity will not unreasonably interfere with the efficient movement of traffic; and</P>
<P class="paraindent1">(4) The activity is not for an illegal purpose.</P>
<P>The manager may prescribe the form of the application and may require information reasonably necessary to make the required findings. The manager may place in the permit such restrictions on the time, place, and manner of carrying out the activity as the manager finds reasonably necessary to meet the requirements of this section.</P>
<P class=sec2nos><A id=section7_2_15 name=section7_2_15></A>7-2-15 Certain Devices Banned From Roadway and Required to Yield to Pedestrians.<!--htdig_noindex--><a href="#main"><img src="../images/totop.gif" alt="Go to the top" width="32" height="13" border="0" align="absbottom" /></a><!--/htdig_noindex--></P>
<P>(a) No person upon any roller skate, in-line skate, skateboard, roller ski, ski, coaster, sled, toboggan, toy vehicle, child's tricycle, or any similar device shall go upon a roadway except while crossing the roadway on a crosswalk in conformance with the rules applicable to pedestrians. When so crossing, persons have the rights and duties of pedestrians. This subsection does not apply on any roadway set aside as a play street as provided by <a href="chapter7-4.htm#section7_4_48">section 7-4-48</a>, "Driving on Restricted Street Prohibited," B.R.C. 1981, and so designated by signs.</P>
<P>(b) No person shall ride or operate a snowmobile on any street except upon specific request of a public authority in a time of emergency.</P>
<P>(c) It is a specific defense to a charge of violating any of the provisions of this section that the person was on skis or roller skis, was skiing or roller skiing in safety on a roadway in a residential, public or industrial district zoned RR-1, RR-2, RE, RL, MH, RM, RMX, RH-1, RH-2, RH-4, RH-5, MU-1, MU-3, P, IM, IG, IS, or IMS and was not on a roadway that was part of a state highway, a divided street, or a street with four or more lanes for moving motor vehicular traffic.</P>
<P>(d) A person upon any of the devices listed in subsection (a) of this section shall yield the right-of-way to any pedestrian upon a sidewalk, in a crosswalk, or on a path.</P>
<P>(Ordinance Nos. 5039 (1987); 5241 (1989); 5920 (1997); 5930 (1997); 7522 (2007))</P>

<P>(a) A person driving a motorcycle or moped shall ride only upon the permanent and regular seat attached thereto. Such driver shall not carry any other person; nor shall any other person ride on a motorcycle or moped unless it is designed to carry more than one person, in which event a passenger may ride upon the permanent seat, if designed for two persons, or upon another permanent or regular seat firmly attached to the motorcycle or moped at the rear or side of the driver.</P>
<P>(b) A person shall ride upon a motorcycle or moped only while sitting astride the seat, facing forward, with one leg on either side of the motorcycle or moped.</P>
<P>(c) No person shall drive a motorcycle or moped while carrying packages, bundles, or other articles that prevent such person from keeping both hands on the handlebars.</P>
