<b>What's the difference between biscuits & cookies?</b><br>
Excellent question! The answer is an interesting buffet of linguistics, history, and technology. 
The original term "biscuit" derives from the Latin "bis coctus," or "twice baked." 
Ancient Roman armies were issued <a href="#biscotti">biscuits</a> as part of their rations. Hardtack, ships biscuit, rusk and 
mandelbrot 
descend from this culinary lineage. Advances in technology permitted a wider range of biscuit products. Small cakes and 
delicate wafers were gradually added to the family of biscuits. 
In most English-speaking countries, the traditional definition of biscuit remains. In the United States the term 
   "biscuit" was reassigned to denote a small, soft, quick-leavened bread product served piping hot. It 
generally accompanied meals in lieu of
bread. About <a href="#biscuits">American biscuits</a>.
<p>
According to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, the term "biscuit" debuted in the 14th century.
Primary definition here:
<blockquote>
"Biscuit: 1. a. A kind of crisp dry bread more or less hard, prepared generally in thin flat cakes. The essential ingredients are flour and water, or milk, without leaven; but 
confectionery and fancy biscuits are very variously composed and flavoured. Even the characteristic of hardness implied in the name is lost in the sense �A kind of 
small, baked cake, usually fermented, made of flour, milk, etc.� used, according to Webster, in U.S."
</blockquote>
The <i>OED</i> states "cookie" was introduced to the Engish language during the 18th century via the Dutch:
<blockquote>
"Cookie: 1. a. In Scotland the usual name for a baker's plain bun; in U.S. usually a small flat sweet cake (a biscuit in U.K.), but locally a name for small cakes of 
various form with or without sweetening. Also S. Afr. and Canad."
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Why do we Americans choose "cookies" over "biscuits?"</b><br>
The answer to this is probably twofold: (1) Our early Dutch heritage and (2) Our revolutionary tradition of separating ourselves
from "all things British." 
<p>
"Early English and Dutch immigrants first introduced the cookie to America in the 1600s. While
the English primarily referred to cookies as small cakes, seed biscuits, or tea cakes, or by specific
names, such as jumbal or macaroon, the Dutch called the koekjes, a diminutive of koek
(cake)...Etymologists note that by the early 1700s, koekje had been Anglicized into "cookie" or
"cookey," and the word clearly had become part of the American vernacular. Following the
American Revolution, people from other parts of the country became familiar with the cookie
when visiting New York City, the nation's first capitol, a factor that resulted in widespread use of
the term." <br>

<a name="cookiehistory">
<b>A little bit of cookie history</b><br>
The book <i>Cookies and Crackers</i>, Time/Life Books, 1982 (page 5) provides a history of
cookies that is perfect for elementary gourmets:<p>

"The art of making cookies and crackers is that of turning simple ingredients into wonderful
things....Like cakes and pastries, cookies and crackers are the descendants of the earliest food
cooked by man-- -grain-water-paste baked on hot stones by Neolithic farmers 10,000 years ago.
The development of cookies and crackers from these primitive beginnings is a history of
refinements inspired by two different impulses--one plan and practical, the other luxurious and
pleasure-loving.
     Savory crackers represent the practical and may well have been the first convenience foods: A
flour paste, cooked once, then cooked again to dry it thoroughly, becomes a hard, portable victual
with an extraordinarily long storage life--perfect for traveling....For centuries, no ship left port
without enough bone-hard, twice-cooked ship's biscuit--the word biscuit comes from the Old
French  biscoit, meaning  twice cooked---to last for months, or even years.
     While sailors and other travelers chewed their way through unyielding biscuits, cooks of the
ancient civilizations of the Middle East explored the culinary possibilities of sweetness and
richness. These cooks lightened and enriched the paste mixtures with eggs, butter and cream and
sweetened them with fruit, honey and finally--when the food became widely available in the late
Middle Ages--with sugar...
     Luxurious cakes and pastries in large and small versions were well known in the Persian
empire of the Seventh Century A.D. With the Muslim invasion of Spain, then the Crusades and
the developing spice trade, the cooking techniques and ingredients of Arabia spread into Northern
Europe. There the word cookies, distinguishing small confections, appeared: The word comes
from the Dutch <b>Koeptje [koekje]</b>, meaning <b>small cake</b>.
     By the end of the 14th Century, one could buy little filled wafers on the streets of
Paris...Renaissance cookbooks were rich in cookie recipes, and by the 17th Century, cookies were
common-place." 
<p>
"The term [cookie] first appeared in print as long ago as 1703."
<br>---<i>The Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford]
(page 212).
<p>
"During the seventeeth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries most cookies were made in
home kitchens. They were baked as special treats because the cost of sweeteners and the amount
of time and labor required for preparation. The most popular of these early cookies still retain
their prize status. Recipes for jumbles, a spiced butter cookie, and for macaroons, based on beaten
egg whites and almonds, were common in the earliest American cookbooks...Because it was
relatively inexpensive and easy to make, gingergbread was one of the most popular early
cookies...As kitchen technology improved in the early 1900s, most notably in the ability to
regulate oven temperature, America's repertoire of cookie recipes grew."<br>

<a name="ammonia">
<font color="#003366"><b>Ammonia cookies</b></font><br>
<p>
According to the food history reference books, "Ammonia" cookies are not one specific
cookie recipe but a whole host of edible treats employing ammonium bicarbonate, an old-fashioned
(probably now hard to get?)  leavening agent. Ammonium carbonate is a byproduct of hartshorn,
a substance extracted from deer antlers [harts horn]. Hartshorn is most commonly referenced in
old cookbooks in jelly recipes. It was also known a source for ammonia, which could be used as
a leavener.
<p>
"Hartshorn...1. The horn or antler of a hart [male deer, esp. Red deer] the substance obtained by
rasping, slicing or calcining the horns of harts, formerly the chief sources of ammonia. 2. Spirit of
hartshorn, also simply hartshoren; the aqueous solution of ammonia (whether obtained from harts'
horns or otherwise). Salt of hartshorn, carbonate of ammonia; smelling salt."<br>
---<i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>
<p>
Historic English definitions & sources:<br>
HARTS-HORN, 205. Shavings of the antlers of a stag or hart were the source of a jelly. Nott (1726) is among the authors who explain how to make it. 
(Robert May, 1660/1685) <br>
HARTS-HORN: deerhorn, used as a source of gelatine. (Sir Kenelm Digby, 1669) <br>
HARTSHORN: the shavings of a stag�s antlers were used to set a jelly. In Receipt 194 it is combined with isinglass (see below), a material that eventually 
superseded hartshorn in most cookery operations. (John Evelyn, Cook, C17) <br>
HARTSHORN: See H 22. The receipt is self-explanatory. (John Nott, 1726) <br>
HARTSHORN: a hart�s horn or antler, used as a source of gelatin. Pierre Pomet says that many remedies were prepared from hartshorn and mentions that 
hartshorn jelly was good against fainting and swooning fits, heartburn, convulsions, falling sickness, hysterical fits, and worms. (See volume II, p. 257.)
 (Richard Bradley, 1736) <br>
HARTSHORN, HARTSHORN-JELLY. Hartshorn was formerly the main source of ammonia, and its principal use was in the production of smelling salts. But 
hartshorn shavings were used, in a different operation, to produce a special and edible jelly. In her recipe for a �Hedge-Hog�, 85, Hannah Glasse assumes that 
the reader will know how to make this. A full recipe is given by Nott (1726), and earlier authors.(Glasse, 1747) <br>
HARTSHORN is deerhorn, used as a source of gelatine. (William Ellis, 1750) <br>

"Ammonium bicarbonate...This leavener is the precursor of today's baking powder and baking
 soda. It's still called for in some European baking recipes, mainly for cookies. It can be
 purchased in drugstores but must be ground to a powder before using. Also known as
hartshorn, carbonate of ammonia and powdered baking ammonia."<br>

<font size="4"color="#003366"><b>Animal crackers</b></font><p>
Food historians generally agree the art of crafting small baked goods into fancy shapes
began as a Christmas tradition in Medieval Germany. Lebkuchen (gingerbread) was a highly
sophisticated art. The legal right to make these products was carefully protected by Guilds. They
were sometimes used as Christmas decorations.
<p>
By the middle of the 19th century the industrial revolution made it possible for biscuits, cookies
and crackers to be manufactured in factories. Crisp biscuits (what we Americans now call
cookies) baked in fancy shapes were very popular  in Victorian
England. Some of these biscuits were shaped like animals. "Zoologicals" (animal crackers)
were sold at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia [1876]. They were made by Philadelphia
baker Walter G. Wilson. 
According to a recent <i>Washington Post</i>
article, in 1889 when P.T. Barnum's circus travelled to England, animal cookies proliferated. 
Food companies were most likely capitalizing on Barnum's popular entertainment. Animal
Crackers
manufactured at that time were probably designed as a marketing promotions.
<p>
The earliest mention of animal crackers we have in print is this recipe from
1883:<br><blockquote>
<b>Animals or Menagerie</b><br>
1 bbl flour, 40 lbs sugar, 16 lard, 12 oz soda, 8 ozs ammonia, 6 3/4 gals milk."<br>
---<i>Secrets of the Bakers and Confectioners' Trade</I>, J. D. Hounihan
[self-published:Staunton VA] April 1, 1883 (p. 96)<br>
[NOTE: this is professional cooking text. It does not offer any instructions regarding the shaping
of these cookies. The author offers this interesting preface note on p. 89: "The following recipes
are from threee of the best workmen in the business. One of them is at New York, another at
Philadelphia and the third at Cambridge, Mass. They are all employed in the best bakeries in their
respective localities, and I have their sworn affidavit that they are the recipes they are now
working with, and the best known to them...I am not at liberty to give the names of the parties I
have the recipes from, for reasons best known to myself and the parties"]
</blockquote>
<p>
National Biscuit Company's (now Nabisco) classic Animal Crackers were introduced to the
American public in 1902. According to Nabisco sources, the first Animal Crackers were marketed
as a seasonal item. The brighly-colored box (not the cookies) was promoted as a Christmas tree
ornament, thus explaining the string attached to the top. 
<p>
Although Animal biscuits/crackers are a very simple cookie we find no evidence they were
created/promoted as health foods. 19th century cookie-type health products often contained
arrowroot and Graham's flour (whole wheat). They were not generally marketed in fancy shapes. 
<p>

<p>
"During the 19th century supplies of cheap sugar and flour, plus chemical raising agents such as
bicarbonate of soda, led to the development of many sweet biscuit recipes. In Britain several
entrepreneurs laid the foundations of the modern biscuit industry. The firms of Carrs, Huntley &
Palmer, and Crawfords were all established by 1850. Since the mid 19th century the range of
commercially baked biscuits based on creamed and pastry type mixtures has expanded to meet the
demand..."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.
76)
<p>
"Animal Crackers are actually a cookie, first produced as Christmas tree ornaments in 1902 by the
National Biscuit Company (now Nabisco). They are formed in the shapes of various circus
animals and packed in a box decorated like a circus train. Nabisco currently produces about 7
million Animal Cracker cookies per day."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New
York] 1999 (p. 104)
<p>
"Animal crackers were created and achieved fame many years before the advent ot NBC (National
Biscuit Company). In the beginning they were just called "Animals," They were imported from
England when "fancy" baked goods first began to be in demand here. In the latter part of the
nineteenth century they were manufactured domestically by Hetfield & Ducker in Brooklyn as
well as Vandeveer & Holmes Biscuit Company in New York. Both firms eventually became part
of the New York Biscuit Company and "Animals" were one of their staples. When "Animals"
were adopted by NBC, their name was changed to "Barnum's Animal Crackers," named after
P.T. Barnum, showman and circus owner who was so famous during this era. Barnum's Animal
Crackers provided the nation with a new type of animal cracker, produced in a small square box
resembling a circus cage with a tape at the top for easy carrying. Barnum's Animals appeared
during Christmas season just three years after the Uneeda Biscuit. What was originally a seasonal
novelty proved so popular that it became a steady seller. Soon Animal (the 's' was dropped)
Crackers became part of the American scene and of almost every American household."<br>
---<i>Out of the Cracker Barrel:From Animal Crackers to ZuZus</i>, William Cahn [Simon &
Schuster:New York] 1969 (p. 106-7)
<p>
"P.T. Barnum, the greatest self-promoter in history, had absolutely nothing to do with the box
that bears his name. And never got a cent for it. That's according to our man Fisher of the Barnum
Museum. Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus still doesn't get a cut, or a licensing fee.
This is what happened: In 1889, Barnum decided to do something truly nutty, a tour of England
with his circus. So after his buddy Bailey figured out how, exactly, you get a circus that normally
takes up 10 rail cars onto a boat and across an ocean, Barnum's animals made their European
debut. The English, meanwhile, had already invented something called animal biscuits. Sensing a
marketing moment, several companies started manufacturing animal biscuits with circus
packaging and called them Barnum's. Soon the product migrated across the ocean, where
Nabisco's forerunner, the National Biscuit Co., put them on U.S. store shelves in 1902. Originally
called "Barnum's Animals,'' they became Barnum's "Animal Crackers'' in 1948."

<font size="4"><b>Apees</b></font><p>
There are several theories regarding the origin of the name "A.P." for a particular cookie popular
in the
Philadelphia/Pennsylvania Dutch country. These food historians sums them up nicely:
<p>
"Apee. Also "apea" and, in the plural "eepies." A spiced butter cookie or form of gingerbread.
Legend has it
that the word derives from the name of Ann Page, a Philadelphia cook who carved her initials into
the tops
of the confection. This was first noted in print in J.F. Watson's<i> Annals of Philadelphia</i>
(1830) to the
effect that Ann Page, then still alive, "first made [the cookies] many years ago, under the common
name of
cakes.'"<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New
York] 1999
(p. 6-7)
<p>
"Apeas are a cookie once popular in Philadelphia. The origin of the name is a bit confusing.
Essentially,
they were a form of Anis Platchen (anise cookies) and stamped A.P. to distinguish them from
cookies with
carraway, which were known as "seed cakes." A great many bakers hawked Apeas to children on
the
streets. One of those bakers in Philadelphia was Ann Page. The A.P. became associated with her
name, if
only because Anis Platchen were extremely popular. In any event, A.P. cookies are of German
origin.
Philadelphians called them Apeas, hence the peculiar name, but to call them anything else--such as
Chocolate Apeas, only further muddles the issue."<br>

"Apees.</b><br>
A pound of flour, sifted.<br>
Half a pound of butter.<br>
A glass of wine, and a tablespoonful of rose-water, mixed.<br>
Half a pound of powdered white sugar. <br>
A nutmeg, grated.<br>
A tea-spoonful of beaten cinnamon and mace.<br>
Three table-spoonfuls of carraway seeds.<br>
Sift the flour into a broad pan, and cut up the butter in it. Add the carraways, sugar, and spice,
and pour in
the liquor by degrees, mixing it well with a knife. If the liquor is not sufficient to wet it
thoroughly, add
enough of cold water to make it a stiff dough. Spread some flour on your paste-board, take out
the dough,
and knead it very well with your hands. Put it into small pieces, and knead each separately, then
put them
all together, and knead the whole in one lump. Roll it out in a sheet about a quarter if an inch
thick. Cut it
out in round cakes, with the edge of a tumbler, or a tin of that size. Butter an iron pan, and lay the
cakes in
it, not too close together. Bake them a few minutes in a moderate oven, till they are very slightly
coloured,
but not brown. If too much baked, they will entirely lose their flavor. Do not roll them out too
thin."<br>

Educator brand crackers were produced in Boston from 1885 through the 1980s. They were a
direct early competitor to the National Biscuit Company (aka Nabisco). Through the years, the company has undergone several
reoganizations, mergers, and name changes. The registrations for both manufacturers and trademarks have expired. The brand is no longer in production.

"Let's go back to the days of clipper ships when iron men from New England sailed wooden ships to far off corners of the globe...One of the foods used was 'ship's
bread,' a dehydrated wheat product conceived by a New England baker made from flour, salt and water. To satisfy this need for ship's bread, and other cracker
products, many small bakeries sprang up along the Eastern seaboard. Massachusetts can claim credit for being the mother of the biscuit and cracker industry in the United
States, as within her borders were located the three bakeries, one of them being Butler's bakery at Newburyport, founded in 1791. This was operated by its original owner
and his heirs until the plant was sold in 1891 to the Johnson Educator company, just 100 years after that business was founded. Dr. William L. Johnson, a practicing
dentist, concluded that his patient's teeth were in poor condition because most diets consisted of white flour products and other soft foods. Dr. Johnson decided that a cracker
made from whole wheat which had to be thoroughly masticated, would be much more beneficial to his patients' dental health. After extensive experimentation, he was able to 
make a satisfactory whole wheat cracker. He called his new cracker Educator, as he knew only too well that changing the dietary habits of people required a lot of food 
education. In addition to being benefitted by Educator crackers, many people liked their taste and before long, the good doctor had the nucleus of a biscuit business. he
opened the first Johnson Educator food store on Boylston street in Boston, May 15, 1885. His business thrived; other health-giving foods such a cereal, coffee, maize meal,
hominy, peanut butter and grape juice were sold. He made arrangements for Butler's Bakery in Newburyport to manufacture his products for him. After Dr. Johnson's death,
the business was carried on by his daughter, Norma Johnson Barbour. In 1934, demand for Educator products increased to such a degree that additional capacity was installed
in a large brick building located in Lowell which is the headquarters of his company today. In June 1937, Robert Lee Megowen became interested in the company and 
changed the name to Megowen Educator Food company. Possibly the greatest contribution made by Megowen Educator food company was the introduction of small
packages of cookies wrapped in cellophane. After Mr. Megowen's death in 1954, the business was carried on by his on, William J. Megowen. In March 1962, Megowen-
Educator food company was sold. In June 1962 the name was changed to Educator Biscuit Company, incorporated."<br>

Fig Newtons were first produced in 1891 by the National Biscuit Company, now known
as Nabisco. They have a long and interesting history.





<p>
There seems to be some confusion as to which the year Fig Newtons were created.  The company
that manufactures these cookies (Nabisco) and the town of Newton state the year is 1891. Most
food history sources say 1892.
<p>
The town of Newton celebrated the 100th anniversary of Fig Newtons April 10th, 1991:
"The 100th anniversary of a cookie may not be considered a milestone for the history books, but
residents of Newton believe the Fig Newton's first century is something to celebrate.  Newton is
an all-American city, and the Fig Newton is an all-American cookie," said Linda Plaut, the city's
director of cultural affairs. "We're all proud of that." ...The Newton, as it was originally called,
was created in 1891 at the Kennedy Biscuit Works in Cambridgeport, now known as Cambridge,
said Mark Gutsche, a Nabisco spokesman."<br>
---<i>Associated Press Newswire</i>, April 11, 1991, Thursday, AM cycle 
<p>
<b>This is what the food history books say:</b>
<p>
"Fig Newtons were first produced in 1891, when baker James Henry Mitchell invented a machine
that would allow a cake-like cookie, filled with fig jam, to be made. The machine was actually a
funnel within a funnel, so handy and effective that Kennedy Biscuit Works snatched it up and
started to produce the famous cookie, which became an immediate success. The name of the
cookie originally was "Newtons," taken from the town of Newton, a suburb of Boston...The
Kennedy Biscuit Works later became a part of the National Biscuit Company [now
Nabisco]....Neither the taste, shape, or size of Fig Newtons has been changed in over one hundred
years."<br>
---<i>The Encyclopedia of Consumer Brands</i>, edited by Janice Jorgensen, [St. James
Press:Detroit] 1994, Volume 1 (pps.183-185)--includes a list of articles 
<p>
"Fig...A sweet multiseeded fruit of the fig tree or shrub, usually eaten dried. It originated in
northern Asia Minor. The word is from the Latin 'ficus.' Figs were introduced into America on the
island of Hispanola in 1520 by the Spaniards...Most of the fig crop goes into making a sweet
filling for Fig Newtons...The cookie was first produced after Philadelphian James Henry Mitchell
developed a machine in 1892 to combine a hollow cookie crust with a jam filling. This machine
was brought to the Kennedy Biscuit works, which tried it out in Cambridgeport, Massachusetts,
and the resulting cookie was christened "Newton's cakes," after the nearby Boston suburb of
Newton..." <br>
---<i>The Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani
[Lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1999 (p. 126-7)
<p>
"In 1892 Mitchell applied for a patent for his new machine, which was granted. Although he had
no name for his 'pie,' he thought the idea might be of value in commercial baking. So in 1892 he
persuaded officials of  the Kennedy Biscuit Works, which had recently become affiliated with the
New York Biscuit Company, to try out his new machine, which he shipped to Cambridgeport.
Mitchell personally installed the machine and supervised its functioning...The professional bakers
tasted the final result, found it good and went away impressed....But promotion could not start
until a name was selected...The exciting new product of the Mitchell machine needed some such
name. Later an assistant to James Hazen, manager of the Cambridgeport bakery, recalled, "The
name was taken from the name of the town Newton-a suburb of Boston." When the name was
selected for this new product, it reflected a practice--by Mr. Hazen, who was manager of this
plant--of using the names of towns and cities in the vicinity of Boston."<br>

material and enclose it in cookie dough, and decided to produce a cookie filled with fig jam."<br>

It seems that the cookie itself was first created in 1891, but not marketed under the name Fig

A Fig Newton of His Imagination?
Roser Park was originally developed by Charles Martin Roser, an Ohioan who foresaw the opportunities of the Florida land boom of the early twentieth century. 
The prospect of a leisurely life on the balmy Pinellas Peninsula was drawing a steady stream of emigrants from the cold north, and to accommodate them Roser 
purchased land on the outskirts of another developer's work. The location he selected along Booker Creek was picturesque, geographically and ecologically 
dynamic, and truly unique. Accordingly, he created a neighborhood that was as appealing and diverse as its environment, offering the widest possible array of 
architectural styles. Roser was born in 1864 in Elyria, Ohio. It is believed that he earned his fame and fortune by developing the recipe or baking process for the 
famous Fig Newton cookie, and selling it to the National Biscuit Company (Nabisco). Roser initially had an interest in a cheese business in Wellington, OH, and by
 1899, was operating a candy and cookie factory in Kenton, OH that was turning out fig cookies. Legend has it that Roser sold Nabisco the rights to his fig cookies
 for 1 million dollars, the modern equivalent of about 19 million. Nabisco has maintained for some time that the Fig Newton was invented in 1891 by Philadelphia
 inventor James Henry Mitchell. Mitchell is said to have invented the duplex dough-sheeting machines and funnels that made the jam-filled cookies possible.

According to a Nabisco marketing director, Nabisco purchased Mitchell's fig cookie, his machines and his Kennedy Biscuit Works outside Newton, MA in 1898, 
the same year that Nabisco itself was formed by the merger of the New York Biscuit Company and the American Biscuit & Manufacturing Company in Chicago. 
Nabisco observed further that although they are familiar with several stories claiming credit for the cookie, they have no record of Charles Roser.

More recently, however, Nabisco has seemed more willing to take other possible contributions to the confectionary invention into account. After all, the company 
was formed in 1898 through the merger of 114 bakeries whose 400 ovens combined to consume 2 million barrels of flour a year, yielding 360 million pounds of 
crackers annually. The New York Times reported that "all the biscuit and cracker companies between Salt Lake City on the west, Portland, Maine, on the east, 
and St. Louis and New Orleans in the south, will tomorrow morning be under one management." Individual credit for specific innovations in any one of those given 
markets or bakeries would be difficult to establish with any degree of accuracy after all this time. Some sources say that Roser sold his recipe to the Kennedy 
Biscuit Works before it was swept up by the Nabisco merger."<br>

ABOUT BISCOTTI
<p>
"Biscuit. A small, dry, flat cake, traditionally with good keeping qualities, eaten as a snack or
accompaniment to a drink, and sweet or savory. Sweet biscuits are eaten as an accompaniment
to coffee, tea or milk--and mid-morning wine in Italy--and partner desserts of ice cream. They are
used to make desserts--charlottes in particular--and macaroon crumbs are often added to custards
or creams...In France biscuits are simply regarded as one aspect of petits fours, with their own
wide repertoire...Their English and
French name comes from the Latin bis meaning twice and coctus meaning cooked, for biscuits
should be in theory be cooked twice , which gives them a long storage life...This very
hard, barely risen biscuit was for centuries the staple food of soldiers and sailors. Roman legions
were familiar with it and Pliny claimed that "Parthian bread" would keep for centuries...Soldiers
biscuits or army biscuits were known under Louis XIV as "stone bread." In 1894, army biscuits
were replaced by war bread made of starch, sugar, water, nitrogenous matter, ash, and cellulose,
but the name "army biscuit" stuck...Biscuits were also a staple item in explorers' provisions.
Traveller's biscuits, in the 19th century, were hard pastries or cakes wrapped in tin foil which kept
well."<br>
---<i>Larousse Gastronomique</i>, Completely Revised and Updated [Clarkson Potter:New
York] 2001 (page 113)

"Biscotto. "Twice baked." Dry cookie. Often containing nuts, biscotti are usually slices from a
twice-baked flattened cookie loaf. In Tuscany, biscotti or cantucci are almond cookies. In Sicily,
biscotti a rombo are diamond-shaped cookies and b. Regina (queen's biscuits) are sesame seed
biscuits. B. Tipo pavesini are almond biscuits of Pavia. B. De la bricia are flavoured with fennel

<p>
<b>Recipe variations</b><br>
Almonds, hazelnuts, anise, and sesame seeds were well known to ancient cooks. Chocolate was
introduced to the "Old World" in the 16th century. It took approximately hundred years before
this ingredient was incorporated into European desserts. It wasn't until the 19th century this
ingredient found its way into baked goods. <i>Italian Cuisine: A Cultural History</i> (Alberto
Capatti & Massimo Montanari) references both biscotti and hazelnuts, although not together in
one recipe, as foods relished by the wealthy during the 16th century (p. 128).

<b>ABOUT MANDEL (ALMOND) BRODT (BREAD):</b><br>
The answer to questions regarding the origin of this recipe depends upon whether you are
seeking a culinary history or linguistic study of mandelbrodt. Historians confirm that almonds
were known to ancient middle eastern cooks, and were incorprated into many recipes.
<a href="biscotti">Biscuits/biscotti</a>, twice-baked hard breads, were popular in Ancient Rome and generally spread
with the Romans to other parts of the continent. Back in the day when modern packaging/preservation options didn't exist, 
this dried bread was a sensible option. The term mandelbrot is of Germanic heritage and
this particular food is traditionally associated with Eastern European Jews. Perhaps this suggests
(although the recipe may be ancient) the genesis of the food with this name may be linguistically
placed in Medieval Eastern Europe.
<p>
"Mandelbrot, kamishbrot, and biscotti: three twice-baked cookies. One is Italian. The others are
Eastern European Jewish. Is there a connection? Perhaps. "We've thought about the connection,"
said Peter Pastan, chef-owner of Obelisk, a tiny pix fixe Italian restaurant in Washington D.C.
"Mandelbrot is all over Eastern Europe and in Italy everybody has a different recipe for
biscotti--some with fennel, some are crunchy; the ones around Siena are ugly but good." Mr.
Pastan, who comes form an American-Jewish family, studied cooking in Italy before opening his
mostly Italian restaurant. With a large Jewish population in Piedmont, Italy may have been the
place where Jews first tasted biscotti and later brought them to Eastern Europe where they called
the mandelbrot,
which means literally almond bread. In the Ukraine, a similar cookies not necessarily with almonds
by made at home, thuskamish, was served. In Italy they are often eaten as a dessert dipped into
wine or grappa. In Eastern Europe Jews dipped them into a glass of tea, and because they include
no butter and are easily kept they became a good Sabbath dessert."<br>

<b>English Rusk</b><br>
Ancient Roman soldiers carried a hard bread known as biscoctus. This literally
     translates as  bis/twice coctus/cooked).   
     Rusks are a similar product. Foods of this type existed in ancient Rome, the name
     did not. Food historians tell us recipes for foods named rusk began showing up
     during the reign of Elizabeth I. According to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, the
     first printed record of this word dates to 1595. 
     <p>
     "Rusks are composed of bread dough incorporating sugar, eggs, and butter. It is
     shaped into a loaf or cylinder, baked, cooled, and sliced and then dried in low heat
     until hard. They have a low water content and keep well. Sharing a common
     origin with the modern biscuit, medieval rusks were known as panis biscoctus
     (meaning  twice-cooked bread') and were used as a for of preserved bread to
     provision armies and ships at sea...In many countries there are products which
     resemble rusks in that they are essentially oven-dried bread, whether plain (e.g.
     bruchetta) or of a sweet kind; but they may incorporate other ingredients such as
     spices or nuts, and ar given individual names according to the recipe."<br>
     ---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford]
     1999 (p. 676)
     <p>
     "Rusks are a legacy of Elizabethan naval provisions. They were originally
     smallish lumps of bread rebaked so as to be indestructible enough to last out a
     long voyage. The earliest known reference to them comes in an account of
     Drake's voyages written in 1595:  The provision...was seven or eight cakes of
     biscuit or rusk for a man.' The modern, more refined notion of a rusk as a slice of
     bread crisped by  rebaking emerged in the mid-eighteenth century, and already by
     the end of the century rusks were being recommended as food for very young
     children (a niche they largely occupy today). The word is an adaptation of Spanish
     or Portuguese rosca, which originally meant literally  twist, coil, and hense
      twisted piece of bread'."

<b>About Rusk in America</b><br>
"This was a particularly popular form of small bread or roll among the Quakers and was usually served at breakfast or at 
afternoon tea. In flavor, traditional Quaker rusks shoudl be fainly sweet; in color, they should be deep yellow (from the
eggs) with dark brown tops. In the country, there were usually eaten fresh, although technically a true rusk should be dry
and brittle because it is dried out in a slack oven. The dry rusks were broken up in breakfast coffee or tea. At one time, rusks
were a fairly widespread feature of urban Anglo-American cookery, at least on the East Coast. They were introduced from England,
where they were popularly served as shipboard fare, as dried rusks soulc be laid down in tins or stored for long periods of
time. The name, however, is of foreign origin and may be derived from the Spanish or Portuguese <i>rosca</i>, a twist or
roll of bread. Such small breads often served as part of the traveling fare for Spanish or Portuguese sailors." <br>

an hour; when take them out, break them apart, and put the top ones in other pans, and let them dry slowly in the oven for
an hour or more. This rusk will keep for months, and is very useful in sickness, to make panada; it is also good for delicate
persons that rich cake disagrees with, or to take on a journey. Nutmeg or made to your taste. If you like it richer, two eggs

sort of rusk made by cutting up a small loaf and toasting or baking the slices slowly until they are dry. Hence they are in effect
'twice cooked'--a notion expressed in French by biscuit and in German by zwieback (from zwie, a variant of zwei, 'twice' and backen,
'bake'). The word seems to have crossed the Atlantic with German emigrants in the 1890s. Zwiebacks are often given to

<a href="http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/wakefield.html">Ruth Wakefield</a> [June 17,
1903-January 10, 1977],
Whitman Mass., is credited for inventing chocolate chip cookies at her Toll
House Restaurant in the early 1930s. According to the story, Ruth used a Nestle candy
bar for her
chips. We will probably never know if Ruth was the very first person to put chocolate pieces in
cookies, but she is certainly the one who made them famous. Nestle began marketing Ruth's
chocolate chip cookies to the general public in 1940. The caption under the photograph printed by
the <i>New York Times </i>(January 2, 1985 I 12:5) describing the fire that destroyed Ruth
Wakefield's kitchen the reads "Wreckage of Toll House Restaurant in Whitman, Mass. It was
where the chocolate chip cookie was invented." In the July, 1997 Governor Weld signed
legislation that declared chocolate chip cookies to be the <a

Commonwealth*</a> in honor or Ruth Wakefield (much to the dismay of the Fig Newton

<font color="#003366"><b>Petit fours & mignardise</b></font><p>
The confusion regarding "petit four" is that it is not a recipe. It is a term denoting a wide variety
of small, fancy  cakes
and cookie. Some people today think of petits fours as  defined by mail-order food companies:
bite-sized seasonally-decorated chocolate-covered muli-layered cake-like confections.
<p>
<b>What is a *real* petit four and why the name?</b><p>
"Petit four. A small fancy biscuit (cookie), cake or item of confectionery. The name, according to
Careme, dates from the
18th century, when ovens were made of brick and small items had to be cooked a petit four (at a
very low temperature),
after large cakes had been take out and the temperature had dropped. After the bonbons, dragees,
marzipans, pralines
and crystallized (candied) fruits that were in vogue during the Renaissance and in the reign of
Louis XIV, other tidbits
were created. They required imagination an flair by the pastry cooks to reproduce the large-scale
decorations in
miniature. Careme himself attached great importance to the petits fours known as
colifichets..."<br>
---<i>Larousse Gastronomique</i>, completely revised and updated [Clarkson Potter:New York]
2001 (p. 876)
<p>
"Petit four. A petit four is a small fancy cake, biscuit, or sweet-such as a piece of marzipan or a
crystallized or chocolate
covered fruit--typically severed nowadays with coffee at the end of a meal. The term is French in
origin. It means literally
 small oven', and may have come from the practice of cooking tiny cakes and biscuits a petit four,
that is  in low oven, at
low temperature'. It was adopted into English in the late nineteenth century."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food & Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 252)
<p>
The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> does non include references to this term.
<p>
The oldest reference we find for this term appears in Jules Gouffre's <i>The Royal Cookery
Book</i> [1869] "Remarks
on Dessert. Under this heading I have given a limited number of recipes of Petits-Fours, of
Bonbons and Ices, without
attempting an elaborate treatise of confectionery,-a course which would have required far more
space than I have  left."
(p. 545). Gouffre lists these items under the heading "Petits fours": filbert macaroons, pistachio
macaroons, chocolate
macaroons, macaroons souffles, lemon massepains (marzipan), almond paste loaves flavoured
with orange, almond
paste loaves with apricot jam, almond paste crescents, almond paste cakes, almond paste rings,
almond paste tartlets
with pine-apple, ice wafers, dutch wafers, Raspberry bouchees de Dames, coffee glaces,
marascsino glaces, small
meringues with cherries, etc.

The first mention of "petits fours" in <i>The New York Times</i> was a menu for a dinner given
by Mr. Randolph
Guggenheim (lawyer), January 28, 1894 (p. 17).

<a name="mignardise">
<b>ABOUT MIGNARDISE</b><br>
The term mignardise, as applied to the culinary world, means an assortment of small, dainty
confections.
This assortment is generally composed of <a href="petitsfour">petits fours</a> in the larger sense: tiny decorated cakes,
specialty
cookies, bonbons and sugared fruits. In other words, a plate of identical petits fours confections
(no matter
how ornate) would not be considered a mignardise. A mixed presentation of small, decorated
specialty
pastries, cookies and candies would qualify as mignardise.

<a name="#rugelach">
<font color="#003366"><b>Rugelach</b></font><p>

Cream cheese cookery is a Central European tradition with ancient Middle Eastern roots. Cookies,
pastries and cakes combining this ingredient with fruits, jams, nuts and spices are specialties of
this part of the world. According to the food historians, contemporary Jewish-American rugelach
(typically made with cream cheese) descends from this tradition. George Lang's <i>The Cuisine
of Hungary</i> [New York:Atheneum 1982] contains several examples: Dios szelet (walnut pie),
Edes okorszem (Sweet Bull's Eye) and Gyumolcskosarkak (Little Fruit Crescents) among them. 
<p>
These cookies are known by different names in different countries: Kipfel (Germany), kifli
(Yugolsavia) and cream cheese cookies (United States). Presumably, the first recipes for
rugelach-type foods were introduced to America by immigrants from Hungary, Yugoslavia and
neighboring countries. Some of these immigrants were Jewish.
<p>
The word "rugelach" descends from Yiddish linguistic traditions. There are several spellings and pronunciations. Although
some food history books state the word "rugelach" means "royal," Yiddish language scholars trace this word to Polish roots. Polish culinary
scholars agree: 
<p>
"Rogale or crescent rolls (called crostulli in Latin) are half-moon shaped rolls made of high-quality wheat flour. The Polish
word rogal means 'horn.'"<br>
---<i>Food and Drink in Medieval Poland: Rediscovering a Cuisine of the Past</i>, Maria Dembinska [University of
Pennsylvania Press:Philadelphia PA] 1999 (p. 116)



<p>
Mildred Bellin's <i>Jewish Cookbook</i> [Tudor Publishing:New York, 1958] offers two recipes
for rugelach. One is a traditional yeast based product, the other is discreetly tucked under 
"Hungarian cream cheese cookies,Variation II," containing unsalted butter, cream cheese, sugar,
flour and salt. Ms. Bellin observes: <blockquote>
<p>
"The variety of cookies and confections which may be found in a Jewish home reflects the long
history and international background of its inhabitants. There are for the holidays traditional
sweets, some of which like Hamantaschen, are a historic part of the festival. Others originated in
the many lands in which the Jewish people lived, but through the generations became part of their
own tradition. The cookies popular in the United States today are eagerly tried by Jewish cooks,
and are served as frequently as the older ones." (p. 262)
</blockquote>
<p>
"There is no other Jewish sweet that has gone more mainstream than rugelach. Basically a
crescent-shaped cookies...it is also called kipfel,
cheese bagelach, and cream-cheese horns of plenty in this country. The yeast-based and often
butter or sour cream-based dough in Europe was usually rolled out into circles, cut into pie
shapes, covered with nuts, raisins, sugar, and cinnamon and then rolled up like pinwheels. It can
also be rolled out into a rectangle, covered with filling, rolled up, and cut into circles...The
American addition to rugelach was cream cheese and the myriad fillings used today. The
cream-cheese dough may have been developed by the Philadelphia Cream Cheese Company
because the
dough is often called Philadelphia cream-cheese dough. One of the the early cream-cheese doughs
appeared in <i>The Perfect Hostess</i>, written in 1950 by Mildred Knopf. Mrs. Knopf, the
sister-in-law of Alfred Knopf the publisher, mentioned that the recipe came from Nela Rubenstein,
the wife of the famous pianist Arthur Rubenstein. It was Mrs. Knopf's friend Maida Heatter who
put rugelah on the culinary map with Mrs. Heatter's grandmother's recipe. It is the most sought
after of all Mrs. Heatter's recipes and is the rugelach most often found in upscale bakeries
nationwide."<br>

Many food history books mention Langue-de-chat, a small, dry, finger-shaped <a
href="#biscotti">biscuit</a> whose name
translates literally as "cat's tongue,"  but none provide much in the way of definative history. We
can surmise from the ingredients/method of cooking, the earliest cookies of this type might
possibly date to the 17th century. At that time refined white sugar and piping bags (capable of
extruding shapes) were popular with the wealthy classes of Northern Europe. Shaped sugar
cookies and sweet biscuits (gemels, gimmows, sugar cakes etc.) date to Medieval times. Mexican
wedding cakes, Russian tea cakes, Spanish polvorones, melindros and biscochos are all related.
Our notes on these biscuits <a href="#mexicanweddingcakes"> here</a>.
<p>
"A langue de chat, literally a  'cat's tongue', is a flat thin finger-shaped sweet biscuit with rounded
ends, typically served with desserts and sweet wines. Its name no doubt comes from its
shape."<br>
---<i>An A-Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 184)
<p>
"Langue de chat...In the view of some experts, this biscuit derives its name from its shape--thin,
flat and narrow, somewhat like a cat's tongue in appearance. Langes de chat, which are crisp, dry
biscuits can be made, or rather flavored, in various ways. Only biscuits made according to the recipe
given below, however, can properly be called langues de chat. These biscuits keep for quite a long
time and are usually served with certain liqueurs and sparkling wines. They are also served with
iced sweets (desserts) and used as an ingredients of various puddings."<br>
---<i>Larousse Gastronomique</i>, Prosper Montage [Crown Publishers:New York] 1961 e(p.
578)
<p>
The earliest recipe we have for Langue de chat was published in <i>The Hotel St. Francis Cook

century American cuisine.<br>

<p>
<b>[1927]<br>
"Cats' Tongues, or Finger-Biscuits (Langues-de-Chats Fines)</b><br>
The dough for this kind of cookie varies, but they are always cooked in the same way; it requires the use of thick black
steel baking sheets; the cats' tongues will color too much on a thin baking sheet. If possible, it is a good idea to have two baking
sheets, so that you can shape the dough on the second while the first is in the oven. Also, you need a pastry bag fitted with
a nozzle 1/2 centimeter (3/16 inch) in diameter...If ou do not have one, you can use a large cone of heavy paper, cutting the end
to the right diameter. You have to prepare as many cones of paper as the number of times you would need to refill the pastry bag,
because these paper cones can be used only once. Time: 1 hour for the preparation. Makes 5 dozen.<br>
125 gram (4 1/2 ounces, 9 tablespoons) of fine butter;<br>
160 grams ( 5 2/3 ounces) of good sifted wheat flour;<br>
140 grams (5 ounces) of confectioners' sugar;<br>
1/2 teaspoon of vanilla powder; 2 egg whites beaten into a snow.<br>
Procedure: Once the flour has been strained through a drum sieve or sifted, mix in the confectioners' sugar and the vanilla
powder, then sift everything a second time through the drum sieve onto a stiff sheet of paper. Leave it on the table. Have
ready the baking sheets, lightly buttered, as well as the pastry bag or the paper cones. In a terrine large enough to be able
to mix the whites, work the mixture as directed...The whisk the egg whites into a snow...Add the prepared flour and sugar to the 
butter made into a pomade by lightly shaking the sheet of paper above the terrine while mixing with the wooden spoon, without
working the dough too much. Finally, incorporate the egg whites beaten into a snow with the movement and care required for this
mixture...Immediately afterward, fill the pouch of the paper cone. Pipe the dough onto the baking sheet in little sticks about half
the length of a pencil. Leave about 3 centimeters (1 1/8 inches) of space between each little stick, because the dough will
spread out a great deal when baking. Then immediately put them into an oven at a good medium heat for 7-8 minutes, until 
only the edge of the cookies has taken on a lightly brown golden tint. Take the baking sheet out of the oven and loosen the 
cookies from it by passing the flexible blad of a large knife under them."<br>

<font color="#003366"><b>Lemon bars</b></font><p>
The term "bar cookies" or "squares" originated in the 20th century. The earliest examples we find
in
American cookbooks are from the 1930s [Date bars]. A survey of cookbooks suggests these
recipes gained
popularity as decades progressed. Food historians do not credit a specific person/place with the
invention of
"bar cookies."  Presumably the practice evolved from earlier recipes, most notably brownies and
fudge.

<p>
<b>About lemon bars</b><br>

Lemons are ancient foods enjoyed in many cultures and cuisines from the beginning of time
through
present day. The figured prominently in custards, pies, cheesecakes, candies, and baked goods.
They were
also used to flavor savory dishes (lemon chicken, etc.). Lemon bars, as we know them today,
evolved from
Renaissance times. Why? The ingredients provide the answer. This is when shortbread/crust was
developed, lemon custard was very popular and sugar was sprinkled on everything. 
<p>
"Buttery lemon bars. The two components of these luscious bars--shortbread and lemon curd--are
old English favorites.
But layering the two in  a bar cookie is, I believe, a twentieth century innovation. My friend and
colleague Joanne Hayes,
food editor of <i>County Living</i> magazine, remembers lemon bars being tested while she was
at McCall's magazine
back in the '60s. Yet the <i>McCall's Cook Book</i> (1963) doesn't include them. Nor do other
magazine cookbooks of
that time. My hunch is that dessert specialist Maida Hatter popularized lemon bars. Two of her

<font color="#003366"><b>Mallomars</b></font><p>
If you have to ask "what is a Mallomar?" you didn't grow up in the greater New York area. 
These chocolate enrobed
marshmallow treats are in a class by themselves. According to the record of the records of the <a
href="http://www.uspto.gov">U.S. Patent and Trademark Office</a>, they were introduced to
the American public
November 20, 1913 by the National Biscuit Company (registration number 0096171). They have
been a fall tradition
ever since. Why New York and why fall? Nabisco claims its because the product doesn't travel
well and chocolate
doesn't sell in the warmer months. Whatever. Those of us who still live around the city know it's
fall when the
Mallomars come back. Sort of like when the swallows return to Capistrano. 
<p>
<b>This is what the food historians have to say on the subject:</b>
<p>
"On November 13, 1913, another famous cookie was born. Mallomar was described as "a
delightful combination of
marshmallow, jelly and layers of cake covered with chocolate icing." For several years before
Mallomar, the company
made a product called "Marshmallow Cream Sandwich," It was also convered with chocolate by
only sold in bulk. When
the formula for Mallomars was perfected, it was decided to make them a specialty and to pack
them in the In-er-seal
package. Later it, too, was made available in bulk."<br>
---<i>Out of the Cracker Barrel: From Animal Crackers to ZuZus</i>, William Cahn (p.
144)<br>
[NOTE: this book is about the history of the National Biscuit Company/Nabisco--your librarian
can help you find a
copy.]
<p>
The earliest Mallomar advertisment we've found far was published in the 1930s: "Chocolate Mallomars, 2 pkgs, 19 cents," <i>New York Times</i>,
November 9, 1934 (p. 15). Our survey of ad placed in historic American newspapers confirms the "seasonality" of this product.
<p>
<a name="mallomarstory">
"In a few weeks, a small but fiercely loyal group of consumers will breathe a collective sigh of
relief as they again are
able to buy their favorite cookie. Following a traditional warm weather hiatus, the first batch of
Mallomars cakes have
rolled out of the ovens and will soon be on store shelves. Mallomars, for those who have never
tried one, consist of a
vanilla base cookie topped with a marshmallow dome and coated in dark chocolate. It is the
chocolate that accounts for
the seasonal nature of the cookie. ''I wish we could produce and sell them year round but the
chocolate melts during the
summer,'' said Henry Havemeyer, plant manager of the Philadelphia bakery of Nabisco Brands
Inc. Havemeyer's facility
is the world's only source of Mallomars. 
So each year, Nabisco halts Mallomars production, usually in late April and generally starts in
again in late September.
And each year, consumers follow what has become a ritual among Mallomars fans. 
In a recent letter to Nabisco, a man representing the ''Mallomars Fan Club of South Connecticut''
explained, ''Early in the
spring, our members stockpile Mallomars, in their freezers, for the summer months. Sixteen or 18
packages per person
seem to be adequate to stave off Mallomars withdrawal until the product reappears in
September...'' 
Mark Kapsky, category business director for the Biscuit Division of Nabisco Brands, said the
cookie has achieved
almost a cult status among many people. ''Mallomars basically sells itself. We do little advertising
or promotion and still
sell every cookie,'' Kapsky said. The loyalty consumers have toward the chocolate encased cookie
was described by a
Florida man in a letter this spring, ''I'm a bit past 40 now and I guess I've been eating Mallomars
since I was about 8
years old. At approximately two boxes a week, 18 cakes per, well, that computes to 29,952
already consumed, give or
take a couple...'' 
The majority of Mallomars sales are tallied in the New York metropolitan area and Miami,
according to Kapsky.
Although available in some additional pockets of the
country, since its introduction in 1913 the cookie has been a big seller in places like Brooklyn,
N.Y., northern New Jersy
and Long Island. The regional nature of the brand accounts for many of the letters the company
receives from consumers
regarding Mallomars. The author typically is a person who moved from the New York area and
cannot find the cookie in
his or her new city....
This past spring, however, Kapsky said the company received hundreds of unexpected complaints.
A sales surge in
March and April meant that when people went to buy their summer stash, there were few bright
yellow boxes of
Mallomars to be had. And when they're gone in April, they're gone until production resumes in
September..."<br>

<b>Do you remember eating Mallomars in the summer?</b><br>
 Today's food writers happily perpetuate
the myth of the <a href="#mallomarstory">Mallomar season</a>. It makes good copy. <b>It is true</b> that today's
 Mallomars are introduced in 
September/October. Production ceases in March/April. The product lingers in the supermarket for a while then disappears
 from the shelves altogether. The reason offered by the company is that the chocolate covering is delicate and cannot survive hot summer months. Was it always this 
way? No. Our research confirms not only were Mallomars sold in the summer, they were sold all over the country. Up until recently.
 Mallomar nostalgia articles proliferate in the 1980s-1990s. This is about the time we find first print references to
 this product's seasonality. Coincidence?

It IS
connected with the tradition of saving rich and expensive food (the richest butter,
finest sugar, choicest nuts) for special occasions.
<p>
Food historians trace the history of these cookies and cakes to Medieval Arab cuisine, which was
rich in sugar. Small sugar cakes with nuts (most often almonds) and spices were known to these
cooks and quickly adopted by the Europeans. This sweet culinary tradition was
imported by the Moors to Spain, diffused and assimilated throughout Europe, then introduced to
the New World by 16th century explorers. <a href="#sugarcookies">Sugar cookies</a>, as we

They first appear in American cookbooks in the 1950s.
<p>
<B>ABOUT THE DIFFUSION OF MEDIEVAL ARAB CUISINE</b><br>
"...in looking for the roots of Spanish food traditions one must go back to the Phoenicians, who
founded the city now called Cadiz in 1100BC; the ancient Greeks, and the Carthaginians...and
more important, the Romans who used Spain as a major source of food, especially wheat and
olive oil...Introductions by the Arabs were also of fundamental importance for Spain's future.
They are particularly associated with the use of almonds (the essential ingredient for so many
Spanish desserts, baked goods, and confectionery items); with the introduction of citrus fruits
(including the lemon and the bitter (Seville) orange, without which British marmalade would
never have been born); sugar cane and the process of refining sugar from its juice..."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p.

"...the Spanish sweet tooth is gratified by a range of dessert wines and liqueurs and
special-occasion candies, some of almost Oriental sugariness. Almonds and honey are included in
many of them Turron, or nougat, white or dark, soft or brittle, is exceedingly more-ish and is now
a big industry in Jijona. The Arabic influences in candy-making are pronounced and candies such
as
amarguillos date from Moorish times...In the Spanish kitchen, milk and cream are commandeered
for desserts, particularly in the north...The national dessert...is caramel custard, called flan."<br>

"Sevillian sweetmeats are the most popular in all of Spain. The art of Sevillian baking has enjoyed
great fame ever since Renaissance times, although in fact it goes back to the Arabs, whose passion
for honey, almonds and pine kernels is still very evident in today's sweets. Sevillian master bakers
produce a wide range of delicacies, including tortas de aceite (very flat, round, flaky cakes), which
originated in nearby Castilleja de la Cuesta, and polvorones (sweet, crumbly, almond cakes),
which are first recorded as being made in Estepa."<br>

<b>"Biscochitos (Spanish cookies)</b><br>
Biscochitos are a "new world" food with "old world" roots. Introduced to Mexico by Spanish
explorers in the 16th century, their true origin can be traced to Medieval Arabian cuisine. When
the Moors invaded Seville, they brought this recipe with them. Biscochitos (known in many
countries/cusines by different names) are traditionally associated with holiday feasts; most notably
Christmas. Variations on this recipe are endless. Orange juice/rind  is probably one of the
oldest...Seville is/was famous for oranges. <a

     <b>MEXICAN WEDDING CAKES</b><p>
     The cookie is old, the name is new. Food historians place the first recipes named
     "Mexican
     wedding cakes" in the 1950s. Why the name?  Our books and databases
     offer no
     explanations. Perhaps timing is everything?  Culinary evidence confirms Mexican
     wedding cakes
     are almost identical to Russian Tea Cakes. During the 1950s and 1960s relations
     between Russia
     and the United States were strained. It is possible the Cold War provided the
     impetus for
     renaming this popular cookie. Coincidentally? This period saw the mainstreaming
     of TexMex

"IMMEDIATELY apparent in Stephanie Alexander's new book, Recipes My Mother Gave Me, is the sense of family tradition. Many of the recipes are taken 
from her mother Mary Burchett's book, <i>Through My Kitchen Door</i>, published in 1960. Melting Moments, Peach Melba, Battered Steak with Peas, 
Cabbage Rolls and Lemon Butter are stand outs. Since Alexander's decision to close her internationally recognised and award-winning restaurant, Stephanie's, at 
the end of this year, Alexander has opened the Richmond Hill Cafe and Larder in the inner Melbourne suburb of Richmond. It is in this informal setting, between 
sips of peppermint tea, that she speaks about the importance of passing recipes on from one generation to another. "I believe there is a lack of cooking skills which
 is not one generation deep but I think it is at least two generations deep. For the mothers of most of today's teenagers, and even perhaps a little older, they don't 
know how to cook. They have abandoned their mother's traditions...If Recipes My Mother Gave Me is to have lasting influence, it may not necessarily and perhaps 
surprisingly be due to the recipes it contains.Although showing how the handing down of recipes in a family can offer lasting pleasures, the book's wider significance

"Melting Moments is another delicious cooky. As the name implies, these cookies are so rich with butter that they do melt in the mouth. Cornstarch, another 
ingredient, also contributes to the tenderness of these cookies for which Mrs. Paley gave the following recipe:<br>

1 cup butter<br>
1/2 cup confectioner's sugar<br>
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour<br>
2 tablespoons cornstarch<br>
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br>
Pinch of salt.<br>
1. Cream the butter. Gradually stir in the sugar and beat untl light in color.<br>
2. Sift flour. Measure, add cornstarch and sift again. Add to butter mixture. Add remaning ingredients and mix until well blended.<br>
3. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto a greased cooky sheet and bake in a moderate ofen (350 degrees) for fifteen minutes or until the cookies are a pale golden color.

Food historians tell us unbaked confections composed of nuts, dried fruit, seeds and sweeteners were made by ancient Middle
eastern cooks. "No bake" candies, as we Americans know them today, surfaced in cookbooks published during the Great Depression.
Like their ancient counterparts, contemporary "No Bakes" contain dried/desiccated fruit, nuts, and/or seeds glued together
with a sugar (honey, Karo) or fat (peanut butter, butter, margarine). No bake cookies (generally pressed into a pan and cut in 
squares/bars) descend from the same tradition. These recipes appear in the 1950s. The primary difference between bake and no bake'
recipes (besides the obvious oven time, of course!) is the "no bakes" do not contain eggs or flour. They are not intended to rise.

     <font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Oatmeal cookies</b></font><p>
Oatmeal cookies, as we Americans know them today, descend from ancient bannocks and
oatcakes known to peoples of the British Isles. The raisins, nuts, and spices commonly found in
today's oatmeal cookies date to the Middle Ages. Oats, and their recipes, were introduced to the
New World by European explorers in the 17th century.  In 19th century America, oats were
considered health foods. They were recommended to invalids and served as hearty breakfast fare
(mush/porridge). Culinary evidence confirms the crossover from "health food" to confection
occured around the turn of the 20th century. Several other popular American foods made the
same leap at this juncture (thanks to corporate America): breakfast cereal and chocolate pudding
among them.

<b>About oats, oatmeal, oatcakes & bannocks</b><p>
"Oats...The first traces of cultivation...date from about 1000 BC in Central Europe. However, the
Greeks
and Romans of classical times were unimpressed, regarding oats as coarse, barbarian fare; and the
Romans used them mainly as animal fodder, but did foster the growing of oats in Britain, where
they were
to become important as a food for human beings. Indeed, they became the principal cereal in
Wales and,
even more markedly, in Scotland...There seems to be an affinity between oats and people of Celtic
origin."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University:Oxford] 1999 (p. 547)
<p>
"The cereal grass which produces the seeds called oats originated as a weed in wheat and barley
fields, which was accidentally harvested with the main crop. In due course it came to be cultivated
in its own right in northern Europe, and was introduced to Britain in the Iron Age. The Romans
knew of it (their word for it was avena...), but only as a weed, or as a fodder plant--although
Pliny, anticipating Dr. Johnson, mentions that the Germanic peoples made porridge with it. The
word oat, which is a descendant of Old English ate, is a pure English term, with no known
relatives in other languages. The remaining Germanic languaves have interrelated names for the
plant...Oatmeal, the term for flour made from oats, was coined in the fifteenth century."<br>
---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p.
229)<br>
[NOTE: Oatmeal, ground oats mixed with milk/cream, descends from ancient <a
href="foodpuddings.html#pease">pottage</a>. These econmical, nutritious, belly-filling dishes
provided energy needed by hard working people.]

<p>
"Oatcakes made from oats (in the form of oatmeal), salt, and water, sometimes with a little fat
added, were
the staple food of the inhabitants of the Pennines and the Lake District in England and of the
Scottish
Highlands for centuries. In these upland regions oats are the only cereal which will ripen in the
cold wet
climate. Oatcakes...were also of some importance in Wales and Ireland. They remain popular, and
are now
generally regarded as a Scottish specialty...Oatcakes had some importance as festive foods,
especially at
Beltane (1 May, and ancient Celtic festival) and Christmas."<br>
---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i> (p. 546)
<p>
"There is evidence that oats were quite qidely grown in Anglo-Saxon England, on athylle (on oat hill)  is recorded in 779...The bishop
of Worcester's oat land is mentioned in a boundary charter of 984. However, oats do not feature in dues and rents as wheat
and barley do...oats may have been used for human consumption: while Pliny was not complimentary about oats he noted they were made
into porridge in Germany. Giraldus was perhaps sensationalising matters when he commented that the whole population of 
Wales lived almost entirely on oats. In times of dearth they may have been utilized quite generally, but they could have been a staple
crop in aras with damp, acid soils."<br>

"The word  'bannock' covers several different kinds of foods: generally it refers to griddle or girdle
cakes
made with oatmeal, barley meal, pease-meal or with flour, but there is the Selkirk Bannock...and
the
Pithcaithly Bannock...which are sweetened tea-breads or cakes. From the earliest years special
kinds of
bannocks were made for every Highland quarter day: on 1 February, the Bonnack Bride (St.
Bride's
bannock) was cooked to celebrate the first day of Spring; the Bonnach Bealtain (Beltane
bannock) for the
first day of summer, Bonnach Lunastain (Lammas bannock) for the first day of autumn and the
Bonnach
Samhtain (Hallomas bannock) for the first day of winter. Bannocks were baked for a child's birth
(Cryin'
Bannock), and there was a Teethin' Bannock baked with a ring in it which was later used as a
teething ring,
and when the bannock broke each person present got a small piece of it. There were special
bannocks
fired for St. Columba's Eve, for marriage and for Christmas. Each one was a variety of
oatcake...some
made with eggs, butter, cream and sugar. Today many of these customs have died out but the
bannock
remains in several forms. If using a griddle then it must be warmed up before starting to
cook."<br>

<b>About oats in America</b><p>
"Oats were introduced to North America by early European explorers including Captain Bartholomew Gosnold, who planted them on Elizabeth Island off the Massachusetts coast. The
Dutch grew oats in New Netherlands by 1626, and they were cultivated in Virginia prior to 1648.
Oats were generally grown throughout colonial America, mainly for animal feed, but Scottish,
Dutch, and other immigrants used them in their traditional porridges, puddings, and baked goods.
Hannah Glasse's <i>Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy</i> (1747 and subsequent editions)...includes
oats in recipes for haggis, flummery, and hasty and other puddings, as well as for cake. Similar
recipes were published in America throught the nineteenth century. Other oat recipes published in
the United States included Scotch burgoo, an oatmeal hasty pudding in which the rolled oats were
stirred into boiling water until the mixture thickened; gruel, which was a thinner porridge
frequently identified as invalid food; and oatmeal blancmange. Baked goods included Scottish and
English oaten cakes baked on a griddle, muffins made from cold cooked oatmeal, and bread and
biscuits, for which the oatmeal was usually mixed with flour, because on its own, oatmeal or oat
flour does not develop enough gluten to support rising bread. By the nineteenth century, grocer
stores sold oat products in bulk...In 1877, rolled oats were developed and trademarked by Henry
D. Seymour and William Heston, who had established the Quaker Mill Company. The product
was baked in cardboard boxes...In 1901, the Quaker Mill Company merged with other mills, and
became the Quaker Oats Company. Directions for cooking oatmeal were printed on the outside of
the Quaker box. These recipes, in turn, were reprinted in community and other cookbooks, and
oatmeal became more popular as a cooking ingredient. During the twentieth century many new
oatmeal recipes were published, including ones for soup, cakes, cookies, wafers, drops,
maracroons, quick breads and yeast breads, muffins, scones, and pancakes. Oatmeal was also used
as a filler and binder in meatloaf..."<br> ---<i>Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America</i>, Andrew F. Smith editor [Oxford

"One-Bowl Method"</b><br>
"On our recent tour through midwest food companies, we stopped at the Quaker Oats test kitchen in Chicago to find Mrs. Reidun Kober, its director, eager to 
report a new system of mixing cookies that has been developed there. It is a one-bowl method, and any woman who has made one-bowl cakes knows why Mrs. 
Kober and her staff wanted to adapt this type of recipe to cookies. The system eliminates the separate creaming of shortening, which is so time-consuming, and cuts
 the conventional mixing time for cookies from ten (or more) minutes to two. All the ingredients are emptied into a bowl, beaten for a couple of minutes--and,
 presto, the batter is ready for baking. Curtailing time does not sacrifice flavor, either. Mrs. Kobler reminded us of the high protein content of oatmeal (the highest 
of any cereal) and its low cost. In baking, it helps to supplant wheat flour, and wheat is needed badly abroad. So on every count--convenience, cost, food 
conservation and nutrition--this recipe for eatmeal cookies should appeal to cooks.
<p>
Into one bowl, sift 1 cup sifted enriched flour, 1 teaspoon baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Add 3/4 cup soft fat, 1 cup brown sugar, 2 eggs, 1 teaspoon 
vanilla and about 1/6 cup of milk. (Fat must be soft--that is, at room temperature). Beat till smooth or about two minutes. On an electric mixer use medium speed. 
The fold in with a spoon another 1/6 cup of milk and 3 cups rolled oats (uncooked). Variations: If desired, add a 7-ounce package semi-sweet chocolate pieces or
 1 cup chopped dates or 1 cup coconut. Drop from a teaspoon onto a greased baking sheet. Bake in a moderate oven (375 degrees F.) for twelve to fifteen
 minutes. Yield: four dozen."<br>

     According to the records of the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov">U.S. Patent and
     Trademark
     Office</a>. Oreo
     brand cookies were introduced to the American public by the National Biscuit
     Company (now
     Nabisco) on March 6, 1912. It is registration #0093009. Nabisco is now owned by
     Kraft Foods.
     <p>
     "On April 2, 1912, the company's [National Biscuit Company] operations
     department announced
     to its managers and sales agents that it was preparing "to offer to the trade...three
     entirely new
     varieties of the highest class biscuit in a new style...The three varieties of
     biscuit...will be known
     as the  Trio. "The varieties comprising the  'Trio' are as follows, namely: Oreo
     Biscuit--two
     beautifully embossed chocolate-flavored wafers with a rich cream fillling at 30
     cents per pound.
     Mother Goose Biscuit--a rich, high class biscuit bearing impressions of the Mother
     Goose legends
     at 20 cents per pound. Veronese Biscuit--delicious, hard sweet biscuit of beautiful
     design and high
     quality at 20 cents per pound. This  Trio is an exciting innovation, and we are quite
     sure it will
     immediately appeal to public favor...<p>
     ...two members of the trio most lavishy promoted in the inital announcement have
     since
     disappeared. But the third, Oreo, was evidently just the kind of cookie the
     American consuming
     public wanted. Somewhat similar to a previous product named "Bouquet," the
     Oreo consisted of
     two firm chocolate cookies with rich vanilla frosting in the middle. The first Oreos
     were slightly
     larger than today's product, but always round. Within a short time Oreo, which
     resembled an
     English biscuit, became a fantastically good seller among NBC sweet goods...The
     origin of the
     name is not really known, although one possibility is that it came from the Greek 
     oreo, meaning
     hill or mountain. Supposedly, either in testing or when the product was first
     produced, it was
     shaped like a baseball mound or hill-hence, an  oreo. This has a certain validity in
     view of A.W.
     Green's [company executive] tendency toward classical names. Oreo was officially
     registered in
     1913 as "Oreo Biscuit." By 1921 it had become "Oreo Sandwich" and by 1948
     "Oreo Creme
     Sandwich."
          Variations have been tried--a vanilla Oreo, a single-cracker Oreo, and in the
     1920s a
     lemon-filled Oreo was introduced. The size has undergone changes, too. Today's is
     about midway
     between the largest and the smallest. Through all shifts in public preferences, Oreo
     has remained
     one of the nation's most consistent favorites.
          As frequently happens with popular products, there are people who fancy that
     they contributed
     to is creation. An Oreo admirer once wrote to the company "During the early
     1920's you have a
     contest offering a cash reward for a suitable name for this particular cookie. I
     entered this contest
     and submitted the name Oreo. Time passed, I learned or heard nothing concerning
     the matter, so
     gave it no further thought until this past Sunday night....If you will kindly check
     your records
     concerning the said contest, I am sure that in them you will find I am the one who
     submitted the
     trade name, Oreo." The company answered, "We think that you must be confused
     about the
     origin of the trademark Oreo. It was not originated as the result of a contest in the
     early 1920's or
     at any other time. It was originated by our advertising department, and first used
     on March 6,
     1912."<br>

     "Oreo. A trademark name...for a cookie composed of two thin chocolate cookies
     enclosing a white
     creme filling. The name...was apparently made up by the company. It has been
     suggested that the
     name may derive from the French word for gold  "or" because the original package
     had the
     product name in gold. Another guess is that the word is from the Greek for 
     'mountain'...The first
     Oreos were sold to a grocer named S. C. Thuesen on March 6, 1912...Oreos were
     not, however,
     the first cookie of this type: "Hydrox Cookies" had been on the market since
     January 1, 1910, but
     Oreos have been far more successful."<br>

<p>
<b>About the cookie's design:</b>
"The ornamental pattern of the wafer itself...is Oreo's visual signature. Stampled out by brass rollers passing over sheets of chocolate dough, the pattern consists of
 a series of four-leaf clovers around the word "OREO," which is set within the traditional trademark of Nabisco, its manufacturer--that trademark being a horizontal
 oval with what looks like a television antenna extending up from it. Around the clovers, a broken line forms a broken circle. Beyond that, the outer edge of the
 cookie is slighly ridged, serving both as a visual frame for the ornamental center and as a means of grasping the cookie with comparative ease. As a design, it is
 pleasantly dowdy, like the wallpaper one might find in an old country house, or the wall stenciling that was common in the early years of this century, when the 
Oreo was created. Although spokesmen for Nabisco say there have been no significant changes in the cookie (except for its size), magazine advertisements from 
past uyears show that this has not been the case. In the 1950's, for example, the word "OREO" was set in a circle, which was surrounded by what appears to be a 
garland of petals. It was a more graceful look a bit closer in appearance to that of the Oere's erstwhile competitor, the Hydrox brand produced by Sunshine 
Bakeries. Hydrox is the Pepsi to the Oreo's Coca Cola; it acutally predates Oreo, though it is less popular. The Hydrox's ornamental pattern is at once cruder and
 more delicate than the Oreo's; the ridges around the edge are longer and deeper, bu the center comprises stamped-out flowers, a design more intricate than the 
Oreo pattern."<br>

"Q. Why is 15th Street at Ninth Avenue now called Oreo Way?<br>
A. Because that is the birthplace of America's favorite cookie. IN 1898 several baking companies merged to form the National
Biscuit Company, Nabisco, and opened a large industrial bakery on Ninght Avenue between 15th and 16th Streets at the Chelsea
Market Building...In 1912, Nabisco had an idea for a new cookie: two chocolate disks with sugar icing in the middle. That year 
Nabisco sold its first package of Oreos to a store in Hoboken, N.J. Since then Nabisco has made more than 450 billion Oreo
cookies. It was the best-selling cookie of the 20th century. Last year Americans dunked, twisted and chomped nearly 12
billion Oreos. Nabisco moved out of the Chelsea Market building in 1958 and now produces Oreos in bakeries around the world."<br>

     Small cakes composed of nuts, dried fruits, and spices were prepared by ancient
     cooks. These
     early cakes were very different from what we eat today. They were more
     bread-like and
     sweetened with honey. The Romans are usually credited with spreading such
     recipes throughout
     Europe. Medieval bakers prefered white sugar and perfected gingerbread, fruitcake
     and a host of
     related sweetly spiced recipes, many with nuts. Northern European bakers
     specialized in cookies.
     When the Dutch arrived in the New World in the 17th century, they brought their
     cookie recipes
     with them. Peanuts are a "New World" food. About <a
     href="foodsandwiches.html#aboutpeanutbutter">peanuts & peanut butter</a>.
     <p>
     We checked dozens of early 20th century American cookbooks and found peanut
     cookies recipes
     were quite common. These, however, called for crushed/chopped peanuts as an
     ingredient. It is
     not until the early 1930s that we find peanut butter listed as an ingredient in
     cookies. The 1933
     edition of Pillsbury's <i>Balanced Recipes</i> contains a recipe for Peanut Butter
     Balls which 
     instructs the cook to roll the dough into balls and press them down with the tines
     of a
     fork. This practice is still common in America today. Recipe here:<br>

<b>Why the classic criss-cross pattern?</b><br>
1930s recipes instructed cooks to create criss-cross pattern on cookie with the tines of a fork.
They did not specify why. Neither do subsequent cookbooks. Craig Claiborne's observations on
the subject are quite enlightening:
<p>
"It has been pointed out, on occasion, that you never can tell what on earth interests readers of
this column and to what degree. With tongue in cheek, we stated recently that we had a file of
letters marked Unanswered and Unanswerable. We quoted one of those letters, not fictional, in
which
someone aked if we could explain why peanut butter cookies were creased with a fork before
baking. We didn't really expect an answer to that, but replies we got. One reader wrote as follows:
The cookies are creased with a fork, she informed us, to make them crisper. "One of my sons,"
she continued, "once answered this technique and baked one pan of cookies plain, the other with
the tradtional fork creases on top. The plain peanut butter cookies did not taste as good and
seemed a bit soggy in the center. "Since the peanut butter cookie dough is quite rich, I think the
fork creases expose just enough dough to add a bit more crispy crust for better results. Another
reader offered this conjecture: "Most cookies dropped by rounded teaspoonsful will flatten in the
oven and bake evenly. Is there something in peanut butter cookie dough that prevents it from
flattening out by itself? The peanut butter, for example? Pressing the dollop with the tines of a
fork would assure the dough flattens properly and, therefore, bakes evenly." But the explanation
about pressing those cookies that we like best came from Sylvia Lavietes of New Haven, Conn.:
"Your column today contained an inquiry regarding peanut butter cookies. Well, a stupid question
calls for a stupid answer. Peanut butter cookies are crisscrossed in order to make it possible to
distinguish them from chocolate chip cookies in the cookie jar."<br>

     <font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Pizzelle</b></font><p>

Food historians confirm crisp waffle-type cookies have ancient roots. These fancy holiday batter recipes were
embraced by many cultures and cuisines: Italian pizzelles, Dutch wafres (waffles), French gaufrettes,
Norwegian krumkake, etc.  The primary difference between recipes is  thickness of the batter and design of
product.  Who made the first food of this type? We will probably never know. History does not typically record
the "invention" of simple foods. We do know, however, that pizzelles and their fancy European cousins were
very popular in the Middle Ages and played significant roles in the Christian calendar, most notably Lent.
Some of these foods later evolved into street fare. 
Fancy shapes, different sizes, decorative patterns, and thickness variations are achieved by special cooking
apparatus called wafer (waffle, gauffre) irons. About <a href="foodfaq2.html#waffles">waffles</a>.

<b>About pizzelle</b><p>
"Pizzelle. A large round cookie made from a rich batter of eggs, sugar, butter, flour, and vanilla, baked on a
specially designed pizzelle iron, which looks like a waffle iron. The intricately carved sufaces of the pizzelle
iron imprint designs onto the cookie as it cooks. Pizzelle become crisp as they cool. While still warm, they can
be rolled into a cone shape, then filled with whipped cream when cool...The Scandinavian version of pizzelle
is krumkake, baed on a similar iron that has the traditional engraved scroll designs."<br>

(p. 236)
<p>
"Pizzelles, a centuries-old specialty of the Tuscan town of Montecatini, are a standard at most
Italian-American bakeries and espresso shops."<br>
---"Pizzelles bring Tuscan Elegance to the Cookie Tray,"  Annette Gouch, <i>Chicago Tribune</i>,
December 13, 2000 (p. 9)
<p>
"One of the many delicacies we continue to enjoy preparing are pizzelle, crisp embossed cookies
from Italy that are baked one at a time in a patterned cookie iron. The word pizzelle, a derivative of
"pizza," means "small cakes." If your grandmother was Scandinavian or French, you may know this
cookie by such names as krumkake or gaufrette. These sweet, lacy cookies are made from a
wafflelike batter that is spooned into an iron mold with two long handles. The resulting cookie is
similar to waffle ice cream cones before they are rolled into shape. In fact, pizzelle come out of the
iron soft and flexible, and you can roll them into decorative cones or cannoli shells. Pizzelle are
usually flavored with anise or lemon, but you can add ground cinnammon, orange rind or almond
extract. Pizzelle offer a good flavor and textured contrast to fruit sorbets, ice creams and custards.
Pizzelle are perfect with afternoon tea or as a light dessert, spread with creamed honey. Although
pizzelle are popular all over Italy, in the south, pizzelle irons are traditional wedding gifts from
village blacksmiths. They come inscribed with the wedding date and the newlyweds' initials.
Subsequent celebrations call for bringing out the pizzelle iron."<br>

     The history of Scottish shortbread is interconnected with the history of dairy

     making in the British Isles during the Medieval Ages:
     <p>
     "As Jean-Louis Flandrin points out, butter consumption is a natural development in
     regions
     suitable for cattle-breeding. In such places, popular taste and the local economy
     had gone right
     over to butter as a cooking fat within 400 years....Flandrin is speaking about the

     the history of butter, including its symbolism]
     <p>
     "Butter was the other principal milk dish [cheese being the other]. The manner of
     making is had
     changed little since Pliny's day...In other branches of cookery butter was an
     enricher, the
     accompaniment of cheese in herbolaces or with macaroni; of eggs, milk and sugar
     in the filling for
     a flathon; of plain or fancy breads in  pain perdu or rastons. For short pastry and
     cakes, it was at
     first an alternative to fresh cream, but eventually superseded it, for butter had a
     more highly
     concentrated fat content, and was more easily stored...Nevertheless butter
     appeared in a relatively
     small proportion of the dishes in medieval recipe books, which were written mainly
     for and by the
     cooks of the nobility. It was only in Tudor times that an emerging middle class,
     which did not
     despise butter as the food of the poor, began to use it liberally in every possible
     sphere of
     cookery, setting a trend that was to last for some two hundred years."<br>

     This explains why the first shortbread recipes date only back as far as Elizabethan
     times. This food
     historian confirms:
     <p>
     "Shortbread...a biscuit whose origin lies in the  short cakes made in the 16th
     century...There are
     many variations. The thick Pitcaithly bannock has peel and almonds in the

     <p>
     According to these sources, if you want to make Medieval/Elizabethan type
     shortbread you might
     want to add some finely ground oats to your recipe. This makes sense given the
     fact that oats and
     butter were staple foods of the poorer classes.

     What about the origin of the name "shortbread?"  According to the <i>Oxford
     English
     Dictionary</i>,
     "Short" (definition 20): Of edible substances: Friable, easily crumbled. This
     describes the process
     of making shortbread. This is also where the English term "shortening" comes
     from. According to
     John Ayto, the term "shortbread" dates back only as far as the early nineteenth
     century. [<i>An
     A-Z of Food and Drink</i>, Oxford University Press:Oxford 2002 (p. 310).] 
<p>
"We all know what short dough is: a rich dough that makes a tender crust, as against the plain dough that turns into sturdy, chewy bread. And then there's shortbread, which always has a lot of butter or other "shortening" in it.
So how come there's no such thing as long dough or longbread? Or an ingredient known as lengthening, for that matter? In exactly what sense does shortening "shorten" anything?
In this case, "short" doesn't refer to richness but to a fragile, easily crumbled texture. Short doughs bake up crumbly because the fatty shortening coats the flour particles, preventing the formation of gluten when water is stirred in.
This is a rather uncommon and specialized sense of the word (in the Oxford English Dictionary, it's No. 21 of the 23 main definitions of "short"). "Short" may have acquired this meaning because it can refer to something that's inadequate--something that falls short, as we say. The idea might have been that short dough was weak, which it is.
On the other hand, maybe the metaphor of shortness came from brick-making. Professionally made bricks are fired in kilns at temperatures so high that the clay fuses into something as hard as rock, but anybody can make sun-dried bricks. The thing that gives a sun-dried brick strength is chopped-up straw; without straw mixed in, the bricks are just fragile lumps of dried mud.
Of course, the same would be true if the straw were cut too . . . short. It may have seemed to people that short dough behaved as if it contained short fibers."<br>

     <b>RECIPES</b><br>
     <b>[19th century]</b><br>
     <blockquote>
     <b>Short Bread, Scotch.</b><br>
     No. 1. Mix two pounds of flour with four ounces of moist sugar, two ounces of
     candied citron,
     chopped small, and two ounces of sweet almonds, blanched and sliced. Rub one
     pound of butter
     into the flour, melt another half pound of butter, and with this work up the four to
     a smooth
     paste. If a plainer cake is wanted, less butter may be used. Sometimes the whole of
     the butter is
     melted, and then the bread is more easily made. Roll out the pastry to the thickness
     of an inch, and
     in a large oval shape, pinch the edges evenly, prick the surface with a fork or
     skewer, and sprinkle
     large comfits over the top. Cut the oval across, thus making two cakes, and place
     these upon
     paper rubbed with flour, and then upon tins. Bake in a moderate oven. When the
     bread is lightly
     browned, it is done enough. It should be remembered that the less the bread is
     kneaded the
     shorter it will be. No. 2. Rub three-quarters of a pound of fresh unsalted butter
     into half a pound
     of flour; add a quarter of a pound of ground rice, four tablespoonfuls of moist
     sugar, two ounces
     of candied citron, finely minced, and an ounce of sweet almonds, blanched and
     chopped small.
     When these ingredients are thoroughly mixed, work the whole into a smooth paste
     with the yolks
     of two small eggs. Roll the pastry out to the thickness of half and inch, divide it
     into four squares,
     pinch the edges neatly, prick the surface with a "dabber" or fork, sprinkle comfits
     and sliced citron
     on the top, and bake as above. Time to bake the bread, half to three-quarters of an
     hour."<br>

     If you camp, you know all about s'mores. These warm satisfying energy-packed
     chocolate treats
     are ubiquitious. Who invented the first s'more? No one knows. We do know the
     three primary
     ingredients
     (<a href="#grahamcrackers">graham crackers</a>, <a href="foodcandy.html#marshmallows">marshmallows</a>
 and chocolate bars) were readily available to the
     American
     public by the
     late 19th century and very popular in the early 20th.  American cookbooks, food
     history sources,
     and
     newspaper/magazine articles confirm these ingredients were used on a regular
     basis, but fail to
     provide us
     with a definative person, place, and date for the invention of the s'more. Why?
     Until very recently,
     camping
     recipes [with the exception of military foods] were typically passed on by personal
     journals and
     word of
     mouth. 
     <p>
     The best we can do on the history of s'mores is start with the oldest documented
     "proof" and
     hopefully, in
     time, work our way backwards.
     <p>
     Where did the idea come from? Victorian-era cookbooks contain recipes for
     "sandwich cookies,"
     soft sponge-cakes filled with jam or cream fillings. American cookbooks published
     in the early
     decades of the 20th century contain recipes for chocolate sandwiches (cool) and
     marshmallow
     sandwiches (warm).  American food companies were combining marhsmallows,
     graham crackers
     and chocolate in the 1910s. These were wildly popular. About <a

     The director of the National Historic Preservation Center, Girl Scouts of the USA
     kindly provided
     this information:
     <p>
     We don't really have a history of how or when some-mores (or S'mores) were
     invented.  Our
     records show
     only that they appeared first in our 1927 book <i>Tramping and Trailing with the
     Girl Scouts</i>. 
     The 1927
     recipe for "Some More" calls for "16 graham crackers, 8 bars plain chocolate (any
     of the good
     plain brands
     broken in two), and 16 marshmallows."
     <blockquote>               <b>"Some More"</b><br>
     
     8 sticks (for toasting the    
     marshmallows)<br>
     16 graham crackers<br>

                                   Toast two marshmallows over the coals to a crisp gooey state
     and then put
     them inside a graham cracker
     and chocolate bar sandwich.  The heat of the marshmallow between the halves of
     chocolate bar
     will melt
     the chocolate a bit.  Though it tastes like "some more" one is really enough.
     </blockquote>
     <p>      The 1940 <i>Girl Scout Handbook</i> has a recipe for one "Some Mores" that
     calls for "4
     squares plain
     chocolate (thin), 2 graham crackers, and one marshmallow.  This recipe may be
     varied by using
     slices of
     apple (cut cross-wise) in place of the graham crackers; by using pineapple slices or
     peanut butter
     in place
     of chocolate."
     <p>
     Our 1947 GSA <i>Handbook</i> confirms this recipe adds these instructions:
     <blockquote>
     <b>"Some-Mores (serves 1)</b><br>
     4 squares plain chocolate (thin)<br>
     2 graham crackers<br>
     1 marshmallow<br>
     Toast marshmallow slowly over the coals until brown. Put chocolate on a graham
     cracker, put the
     toasted
     marshmallow on top, then another graham cracker. Press gently together, and eat.
     Taste like
     "some more."

     The story behind the snickerdoodle is and excellent lesson in food lore.  What little
     is written on
     this tasty treat is hard to substantiate [prove] with primary documents [old
     cookbooks] and
     reference books. Some books say snickerdoodles were popular in colonial
     America. Were they
     really? 
     <p>
     Food historians tell us the history of small cakes/cookies/biscuits with
     snickerdoodle-type
     ingredients dates back to ancient Roman times. Small cakes of this sort were quite
     popular in
     Medieval Europe. In Medieval and Renaissance England, similar cookies were
     called jumbles.
     Germans often added more spices and dried fruits, in the gingerbread tradition.
     When Europeans
     settled in the New World they brought with them their culinary heritage and their
     recipes. We find
     plenty of recipes printed in 18th-19th century American cookbooks that would
     produce
     something quite like snickerdoodles, but they are called other names (jumbles,
     ginger
     cookies).<p>
          Is it possible the recipe for snickerdoodles is very old but the name
     snickerdoodle was invented
     recently? Perhaps. The word does not show up in
     the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, <i>Dictionary of Americanisms</i>, and
     other word origin
     books. The <a href="http://www.uspto.gov">U.S. Patent & Trademark
     Office</a> points us to
     several products with this name, most notably, Snickerdoodle.com (1989). A
     popular children's
     book suggests the word "snicker" may have come from a Dutch word "snekrad,"
     or the German
     word "Schnecke, " both describing a snail-like shape. This is possible. This book
     offers no
     explanation for the "doodle."

     Food historians tell us small hard biscuits were probably first made by ancient
     Middle Eastern
     peoples. These foods were quite practical, as they were filling, easily transported
     and able
     withstand adverse weather conditions. This is why cracker-type foods have a long
     history in
     military rations. Ancient Roman armies ate <a href="#biscotti"> biscuits</a>,
     Nelson's sailors ate
     <a href="http://www.hms.org.uk/nelsonsnavymaggot.htm">Ship's biscuit</a>, and
     Civil War
     soldiers ate <a
     href="http://www.nps.gov/gett/gettkidz/hardtack.htm">hardtack</a>. These are
     all related in method and ingredients to the tasty crackers we buy in today's
     supermarket.
     <p>
     Many cultures and cuisines have developed their own special crackers. Italian
     biscotti, Jewish
     mandlebrot, German zwieback and English rusk are some examples. The word
     "cracker" appears
     to have originated in North America sometimes in the 18th century. Food
     historians generally
     agree that the light, crispy crackers we Americans know today appeared in the
     19th century.
     This concides with the "discovery" of chemical leaveners such as <a
     href="foodfaq.html#bakingpowder">baking soda and powder</a>.
     <p>
     <b>"Cracker</b><br>
     A name first used in N. America,f rom the mid-18th century onwards, for a plain,
     unsweetened,
     dry, hard, bread product; thus corresponding to part of the domain covered by the
     wider English
     term "biscuit." When crackers are broken into pieces they make a cracking noise,
     which accounts
     for the name. Crackers may be leavened or unleavened. Those of the former sort
     were formerly
     baked by a particular method which called for a dough leavened with bicarbonate
     of soda (hence
     the term "soda cracker") and left to stand until pockets of carbon dioxide formed
     in the mixture.
     When biscuits of this dough were placed in a very hot oven they rose quickly,
     giving the
     characteristic texture. Unleavened crackers may be made from flour and water only
     (as are
     matzos) or with the addition of a little salt. Some examples of this sort are the
     small oyster
     crackers, used on top of seafood chowders, and the crackers know as ship's
     biscuit...The cracker
     barrel was an institution in American general stores and groceries which sold
     crackers loose in
     bulk. The term was first used in print in the 1870s..."<br>

     "...Since the eighteenth century Americans have spoken of these wafers by this
     term, first
     appearing in print in 1739, but it is still a word rarely used in England, where
     biscuit is

     "Crackers started out as thin, crisp nonsweet, bite-size flatbreads. The making of
     crackers was
     among the first food industries in America. During the eighteenth century, cheap,
     hard crackers
     called "ship's bread," "ship's biscuits," and later, "hardtack" were widely
     manufactured for use on
     ships and for those migrating westward. These large, sturdy crackers, made only of
     flour and
     water--no shortening--kept for a very long time. One of the earliest brand-name
     foods was Bent's
     water crackers, which were initially manufactured by Josiah Bent, a ship's bread
     baker in Milton,

     <b>Why do some crackers have holes in them?</b><br>
     Soda and [other types of] crackers have holes in them to help keep the product
     even in texture,
     flat in shape and crisp to taste. The process by which the hole are made is called
     "docking." Holes
     are spaced evenly to facilitate the evenness of the cracker. Prior to
     industrialization, crackers were
     pierced by hand using knives, nails and hand-held tools made of cast iron specially
     designed for
     the purpose. Elizabeth David describes a old-fashioned docker as "a
     dangerous-looking utensil
     consisting of sharp heavy spikes driven into a bun-shaped piece of wood."
     <i>English Bread and
     Yeast Cookery</i>, Elizabeth David [Viking:New York] 1980 (p. 200). Why is
     this process
     called docking?
     According to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, 2nd ed., Volume IV (p. 912)
     the origin of
     this word as it relates to biscuit-making is unknown. The first use of this term in
     print is dated
     1840. In 1875 "The biscuit was then docked, that is, pierced with holes by an
     instrument adapted
     to the purpose...A stamping or docking frame..." 
     <p>
     <b>Is the a symbolic significance to the number of holes in a cracker?</b> According to the
     experts at
     Bent's Cookie Factory, the answer is no. The purpose of the holes is keep the
     product crisp and
     even. The number and placement of the holes is determined by the size and shape
     of the cracker.
     There is no evidence to support the theory that 13 holes in colonial
     crackers/hardtack stood for
     the thirteen colonies. In fact? There is no evidence that there were 13 holes in
     these crackers at
     all!

     Did people make soda crackers at home? Yes. Here is a recipe from 1901:
     <p><blockquote>
     <b>"Soda crackers</b> (Biscuits de Soda)<br>
     1 Quart of Flour<br>
     3 Tablespoonfuls of Butter<br>

     1 Teaspoonful of Salt<p>
     Sift the flour several times, and add the salt. Mix well. Then rub in the butter
     thorougly. Add the
     soda, which you will have dissolved in a little boiling water, and the milk and mix
     all well
     together. Then knead well and put upon the biscuit board an beat with a rolling pin
     for upwards of
     half an hour, frequently rolling the dough over, and beating hard until the air
     bubbles cover every
     part, above and below. The roll out into a nice square, even sheet of dough, about
     one eighth of
     an inch in thickness, and cut into nice square cakes. Stick through and through
     with a fork here
     and there over the the surface in even rows, and bake them in a moderate oven till
     they are hard
     and crisp, but not brown. Then hang in a muslin bag for about two days to
     thoroughly dry, and

     The practice of combining hard bread with liquid nourishment is ancient. Roman
     biscuits and
     gruel, Medieval sops and stew, 18th century hard tack and soup, and early 19th
     century common
     crackers and fish chowder are part of a long tradition of using bread to extend thin
     foods to fill
     hungry bellies. Oyster crackers are part of this tradition. These bite-sized crackers
     are closely
     related to common crackers. Their lighter composition is the by-product of
     mid-19th century
     leaveners, most notably baking soda. Today's manufactured oyster cracker
     products are closer to
     saltines than common crackers. 
     <p>Why the name "oyster cracker?" Food reference books do not specifically
     address this
     question. There are (at least) two possibilities based on the history of the product:
     1. They were
     used in chowders (thus the association with oysters) and 2. They looked like
     oysters (crackers are
     three-dimensional if not stamped flat; these lumpy white crackers might have
     looked like oysters
     in shape and color.)
     <p>
     "Common crackers.<br>
     If there has been a constant in the history of chowder, at least for the last two
     hundred years, it is
     the common cracker. A perfect companion for chowder, the common cracker has
     remained
     unchanged...These round pufffed, hollow, very hard crackers have been
     manufactured in New
     England for so long...The common cracker descended from hard tack, also called
     ship's biscuit--a
     very dense, unleavened brick of baked flour. Necessity wrote this recipe, since
     flour would not
     keep in the damp and vermin-infested conditions aboard ship. Hardtack was also a
     staple of all
     along the coast of New England and in the Maritime Provinces of
     Canada...Hardtack had to be
     shaved or shopped off the baked brick, then soaked with water then soften before
     it could be used
     for chowder and other dishes."<br>

     The Vermont common cracker is a curious thing, on two accounts:<br>
     1. According to the food historians Vermont common crackers were New England 
     "inventions" 
     that
     happened sometime in the early 1800s. There are (at least) two claims as to the
     inventor. Yet?
     The name
     of the cracker first appeared in 1939.
     <p>
     2. According to early 19th century New England cookbooks, biscuits/crackers
     were puffed bread
     products 
     which were cut in half and served warm with butter. This makes them somewhat
     different from
     the saltine-type Vermont common cracker we enjoy today. Yet? Hardtack and
     other crisp biscuits
     were certainly known
     and consumed.
     <p>
     What does this tell us? Don't bother looking for recipes for "common crackers" in
     19th century
     cookbooks.
     The best you can do is examine the primary evidence for an approximating recipe. 
     This makes
     tracing the
     Vermont common cracker a bit more challenging. Is the product we enjoy today
     the same item
     our
     foremothers baked? It's hard to tell.
     <p>
     We do we know: The concept of hard crackers (soaked in liquid, as in soup) traces
     back to
     Ancient Roman
     days. Dried bread keeps easily, travels well, and fills the belly. This made it the
     natural choice of
     armies,
     sailors and the like up until recent times. Think hardtack. Colonial-era cookbooks
     and industrial
     revolution-era  manufacturing/retail  literature offer many different types of biscuits
     and crackers.
     These vary greatly in
     size, texture, and purpose.Names for said items range from generic descriptions
     (souffle biscuits)
     to place-specific claims (Boston crackers, Westminster crackers, Trenton crackers,
     etc.) Mid-19th
     century
     technological advancements made saltine-type crackers, as we know them today,
     possible. Some
     of these
     traditional recipes were converted to the ligther, more popular method. General

     <b>ABOUT VERMONT COMMON CRACKERS</b><br>
     According to the <i>Dictionary of American Regional English</i> (Frederic G.
     Cassidy editor,
     Volume 1), the first print
     reference to the term "common cracker" appeared in 1939. Where? <i>Yankee
     Cook Book</i>
     (p. 362): "Common
     Cracker. A large old-fashioned lightly salted cracker also called Boston cracker." 
     This source
     also places the first print
     reference to the Boston cracker to 1818, noting it was a type of biscuit (p. 346).
     Boston crackers
     were served split with
     butter. There is no mention in this source regarding crispness.
     <p>
     "Common  cracker. Very crisp, hard, thick wheatflour cracker that may be split
     and grilled with
     butter or Cheddar
     cheese, ground into bread crumbs, or eaten in chowders; similar to Boston
     Cracker. The term first
     appears in print in
     1939. One manufacturer claims common crackers were first baked by Charles
     Cross about 1830
     in his Montpelier,
     Vermont, bakery, and were called "Cross crackers" or "montpelier crackers." But
     in the <i>New England
     Cookbook</i> (1954),
     Eleanor Early credits the cracker's invention to Artemus Kennedy of Menotomy,
     Massachusetts,
     almost two hundred
     years ago. Early wrote that "Artemus had a large family and it was said that the
     children learned
     to retrieve crackers [that
     Artemus tossed on the floor of a big Dutch oven]...before they could walk. Baking
     was done
     three times a week, and
     Artemus rode about the countryside on his horse selling them from his saddlebags."
     Whatever their
     origins, common
     crackers are no longer easily found, and the news that a Rockingham, Vermont
     citizen named
     Vrest Orton had bought
     the original Charles Cross machinery and begun to sell common crackers again in
     1981 was
     greeted with considerable
     interest by those who remember the taste of dry, crisp morsels split opened and
     eaten with good
     Vermont cheddar."<br>

     [Lebhar-Friedman:New

          "Two years ago Cross Crackers, the thick white crackers that filled American
     cracker barrels for
     over a century, seemed
     headed for oblivion as surely as beer in a bucket. The Cross Baking Company,
     which was in
     business for 151 years in
     Vermont and later in New Hampshire, went bankrupt, and its machinery was sold
     at auction. The
     demise of the cracker,
     however, turned out to be greatly exaggerated, and this edible bit of Americana is
     once again
     baking on the old
     equipment in a new bakery addition to the Vermont Country Store, a thriving
     replica of the real
     thing, in Weston, Vt. It
     is a mistake to suppose that the old-time country store cracker barrel, surrounded
     of course by
     genial, chatting rural
     types, was filled with something like saltines. Modern crackers are thin, uniform,
     Johnny-come-latelies compared with
     Cross Crackers, which were a mouthful - an inch thick, hard, dry, bland and about
     as large as the
     rim of a coffee cup.
     Their keeping qualities guaranteed that those on the bottom of the barrel would be
     as firm as
     those on top. In recent
     years, when the cracker-barrel trade fell off, the crackers, boxed in a distinctive red
     and black
     design, were familiar on
     New England store shelves. These are the New England ''common crackers''
     mystifyingly referred
     to in recipes. For
     years they were a staple of the region's diet, with many people eating them
     crumbled in a bowl
     with milk. Often called
     Montpelier crackers after their home town, they were first made by Charles Cross
     in his Vermont
     bakery in 1830. He
     was a canny Yankee entrepreneur who mixed and baked crackers three days a
     week, using his
     horse on a treadmill to
     rotate the special oven. On alternate days the horse pulled the delivery wagon. At
     that time nearly
     all country or village
     stores bought crackers by the barrel, and before long business boomed. Mr. Cross
     is credited with
     later installing the
     world's first cracker machines, and when he died at 93 in 1905 he was the oldest
     baker in New
     England... The common
     cracker is solid and filling, meant for eating one at a time. On its own it tends to be
     dry and
     tasteless, qualities that
     recommend it highly for additions. The easily split cracker takes well to cheese or
     butter on top,
     which can be toasted as
     well. Although recipes, including cracker pudding, have been included in New
     England
     cookbooks over the years, the
     favorite was for puffed crackers.<br>

     "Julia Child's focus on the common
     cracker underlines the importance of serving something crunch to complement and
     balance the
     soft texture of chowder. Common crackers, Crown Pilot crackers, or other had
     crackers should
     always be offered with chowder, because the toasts are so very dry and crisp that
     they can be
     presented in place of crackers...If there has been a constant in the history of
     chowder, at least for
     the last two hundred years, it is the common cracker. A perfect companion for
     chowder, the
     common cracker has remained unchanged...These round puffed, hollow, very hard
     crackers have
     been manufactured in New England for so long that almost no home cook knows
     how to make
     them. Even those who do know don't bother, because they take almost two days to
     make and if
     you do everything just right, they might turn out as good as the ones you can buy at
     the store. In
     and around New England, you can find common crackers in many specialty and
     seafood markets
     and sometimes in ordinary supermarkets...At its inception, the common cracker
     was known as the
     Boston cracker throughout New England, lending plausibility to the belief that
     Boston was its
     place of origin. Ironically, it was Bostonians who coined the name "common
     crackers," and the
     name stuck--no one calls them Boston crackers anymore, and no one in Boston
     manufactures
     them. The common cracker descended from hardtack, also called ship's biscuit--a
     very dense,
     unleavened brick of baked flour. Necessity wrote this recipe, since flour would not
     keep in the
     damp and vermin-infested conditions aboard ship. Hardtack was also a staple all
     along the coast
     of New England and in the Maritime Provinces of Canada, where villagers faced
     similar problems
     with fresh flour...Chowder was a way to make hardtack edible. When the potato
     became a
     popular ingredient in the early 1800s, it put hardtack out of the chowder business.
     Potatoes
     became the primary thickener in chowders, producing a version that was more
     brothy and lighter.
     But the dry cracker didn't go away completely...The new and improved leavened
     version, the
     common cracker, was and still is very dry, with a hard exterior and great storage
     capabilities. But
     when you split, butter, and toast them, they strike a perfect balance between being
     crisp enough to
     crunch, even after sitting in a hot broth for a few minutes, and having a flaky
     tendernesss..."<br>

     "As any New Englander knows, you can't enjoy a real New England chowder
     without toasted
     common crackers. These are not like pilot biscuits or saltines; they are softly
     crackly, layered,
     somewhat puffy round crackers about 1 1/4 inches in diameter. You split them in
     half, butter
     them, and toast them, and then you crumble them into your chowder. They are
     difficult to find
     outside of the New England area, and the recipe has always been a locked-up
     secret. Our team

1 cup bread flour (available in health food stores)<p>
<b>For the cracker dough</b><br>
1 cup yeast starter<br>
1 to 1 1/4 cups bread flour<br>
6 tablespoons (3 ounces) vegetable shortening or lard<br>
1 teaspoon salt<br>
1 tablespoon instant potato flakes<br>
1 tablespoon light brown sugar<br>
1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br>
3 tablespoons water<br>
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice<br>
An additional 1 1/2 to 2 cups bread flour<p>
<b>Making the starter:</b>
Whisk all the ingredients together into a batter, and store in a covered container at room temperature (70 F to 75 F) for at least
24 hours or up to 60 hours. It will rise and form large bubbles, then subside and separate.<p>
<b>Making the Cracker Dough:</b> Knead enough flour into 1 cup of the starter to make a firm ball of dough. Cover and let rest
for 1 hour. In a separate bowl, whisk the shortening of lard, salt, potato flakes, brown sugar, and baking soda together, mixing
in the water and lemon juice at the end. Knead this liquid into the ball of dough, using the paddle attachment. Gradually knead in 
the additional flour, changing to the dough hook as the dough stiffens. After about 5 minutes you should have a stiff, smooth
ball.<p>
<b>Rolling Out the Dough:</b> Cut the dough into quarters. One at a time, roll a piece of dough into a rectangle 3/8 inch thick 
and, starting at one of the short ends, put through the pasta rollers, fold into three like a business letter, give a quarter 
turn, and roll again. Repeat the process six times in all and going down to position #6 on the machine. Use as little flour
as possible. The final dough should be no thicker than 1/4 inch. meanwhile, preheat the oven to 435 F.<p>
<b>Forming and Baking:</b> Cut 1 1/2-inch rounds out of the rolled pieces, and press the tines of a table fork thorugh the rounds
in two places. Arrange 1/4 inc apart on no-stick or parchment-paper-lined baking sheets. Bake for about 8 minutes, until the
crackers have risen, are light golden-brown, and feel firm to the touch.<p>
<b>Drying Out and Storing:</b> Lower the thermostat to 200 F and let the crackers dry out in the oven for 2 hours or longer--
to dehydrate and crips the inner layers.<p>
<b>Ahead-of-Time Note:</b> When completely cool, store in an airtight container. If they become stale or soft, reheat  for 5 
minutes or so in a 400 F oven."<br>

     "In certain areas of the midwest there was a strong preference for a cracker called
     "Premium

"Ritz, pride of the Nabisco cracker fleet, has been the premium cracker of choice since its
inception in 1934. But its history dates back to the early nineteenth century. It was in 1801, in
fact, that the Ritz cracker got its beginnings.It was in that year that John Bent, a retired sea
captain, adapted a hardtack recipe into a product more palatable to the general public. He took
the hardened "biscuit" (an English designation used at that time) and added leavening agents until
the product was a flat, crisp biscuit. Bent's family handled the baking chores while he traveled the
countryside selling crackers from his wagon. The basic cracker recipe was refined four years later
by the Kennedy Biscuit Works, which used sponge dough for a lighter consistency. In 1898 the
Bent baker, Kennedy Biscuit Works, and dozens of other bakeries across America joined forces
to
form the National Biscuit Company...In 1934 the recipe was perfected, resulting in a smooth,
flaky cracker hinting of butter. Contrary to the pale, square crackers widely sold, these creations
were golden and rounded, with serrated edges. A company-wide cracker naming contest yeilded
the name Ritz. Mass production of Ritz crackers began in Nabisco's North Philadelphia bakery
and on November 21, 1934, the new product was introduced at markets in Philadelphia and
Baltimore. Consumers responded to this new type of cracker...By 1935 Ritz was distributed
nationally. It was initially marketed as a taste of affordable luxury, no small claim during the
Depression years. The positioning worked, with Ritz selling in the five-billion volume
area...during its first year of nationwide distribution. Some of this success can be attributed to the
product's relatively low price; mass production by Nabisco, the only baking manufacturer with
the
facilities to distribute nationwide at that time, kept the price of a box of Ritz crackers to an
affordable 19 cents."<br>

"The National Biscuit Company launched a new and permanent cracker sensation in the early
1930's. For years the company had been seeking a buttery creacker to compete with others in the
field. After a long period of experimentation, a formula was produced. The new product was
called "Ritz." It was a butter cracker, different from a soda cracker in that it had more shortening
and no yeast. It was consequently crisper and less fluffy. A thick coat of coconut oil and a
sprinkling a salt were spread over the cracker after it had gone through the oven. The recipe
seemed simple. But the taste evidently had a special appeal. Furthermore, Ritz was introduced as
a prestige item with such promotional headlines as "Anytime is the right time to serve Ritz,"
"Tomorrow's cracker--today," and "Almost overnight, America's most popular cracker."
     The Ritz cracker took the country by storm. The company baked more than 5,000,000 in the
first year. In three years--aided by imaginative promotion--Ritz became the largest-selling cracker
in the world with more than 29,000,000 baked daily. It became a staple in a huge number of
American households and in foreign nations as well. In Europe a box of Ritz was presented to a
girl friend much as a boy in America presents a box of candy."<br.

"It was during these gloomy days [the Great Depression] that Nabisco cheered everyone up with
a round, buttery, crunchy cracker it called Ritz, hoping to conjure up images of Manhattan's posh

people could afford it and soon made it the best-selling cracker in the world."<br>

fresh-roasted nuts. A delicate tang that refreshes like salt sea air. Crust? The same secret process that creates Ritz'
famous flavor provides a brand new kind of crackling crispness. And this delicious crispness lasts from ovens to you! You'll
know at first taste why Ritz became America's most popular cracker almost overnight. Try Ritz today. Enjoy them alone, or with meat
pastes and other relishes. The see how they bring out hidden flavor in soups, salads, cheeses and even the plainest economy

<b>It is said that the cracker was named for our town because we provided the flour used in making
the
crackers at the National Biscuit Company plant in Portland, Oregon. Fact or fiction?</b>
<p>
Fiction. 
According to Nabisco, Ritz Crackers were named thusly because they conjured up the image of
wealth and
glamour. This was a brilliant marketing ploy for an affordable product launched during the Great
Depression. <i>Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary</i> defines ritz/ritzy this way: "Ritzy [Ritz
hotels, noted
for their opulence] (1920). 1. Ostentatiously smart: fashionable, posh. 1. Snobbish."  Mass
production of this
cracker was conducted in North Philadelphia.
<p>
<b>THE RITZVILLE CONNECTION</b>
<p>
"Townspeople here [Ritzville WA] even like to say--apocryphally, alas, according to the Nabisco
Company--that the Ritz cracker was named for Ritzville. (A Nabisco spokesman says "Ritz" was
chosen in the
Depression because of its "luxurious, hight-class" connotation.)"<br>
---"Fields of Flame Follow The Harvest of Wheat," Sam Howe Verhovek, <i>New York Times</i>,

(p. A10)
<p>
We do not find evidence that Nabisco did business with Ritzville. We do, however, find a
connection
between Nabisco and the Martin Milling Company in Cheney, WA. Unfortunately, without 
specific reference to supplying flour for Ritz crackers. If there's any connection between this town and Ritz crackers,
perhaps this is it:<p>
Behind 601 First St. (1918-1997).
This is a large complex composed of older and newer buildings. On two sides of the tower, facing northwest and southeast, are molded concrete shields enclosing the capital letter "M" for "Martin." The buildings of this complex contain milling equipment and flour moving equipment such as augers and bucket elevators. 
Cheney had several grain storage and milling facilities during its early days and acted as a regional center for concentrating supplies of harvested grain and processing flour. Such activity was a mainstay of the town's economy. As early as 1888, the Cheney Flouring Mills and the Northern Pacific Elevator Company operated large wood frame plants along the railroad tracks. Both of these facilities were gone by 1905. In that year F.M. Martin owned a hay and grain warehouse in a large wood frame building beside the railroad tracks. Mr. Martin began his grain milling business in 1907 on this site. This enterprise not only developed the capacity to store large amounts of grain, but also to mill it into wheat at the same location. The nearby Northern Pacific Railroad tracks facilitated this operation. Harvested grain could be brought to the storage elevators by train, milled into flour, and then shipped to clients. 
At some point, the storage areas and the mill were expanded and a three-story grain elevator (wood crib construction) was added, which subsequently burned in the mid-1910s. Undeterred, Martin rebuilt on site, this time with fire-proof reinforced concrete. The current flour mill and the bank of grain elevators to the northeast were completed in 1918. Additional and larger concrete elevators were added in 1922 and 1923. Subsequent concrete structures were added to the plant between 1933 and 1954. The Martin Grain and Milling Company remained in the Martin family until 1943, when the buildings and equipment was sold to the National Biscuit Company (Nabisco). The business was subsequently operated by several companies, including Ralston-Purina, Centennial Mills and, at present, ADM Milling Company.

     In many English speaking countries, the word "biscuit" refers to a <a href="#biscotti"> hard
     cookie or
     cracker</a>. In the United States biscuits are generally small soft, yeast-based
     products served
     with breakfast or dinner. They perform a variety of functions including filling
     (hungry bellies), 
     topping (eg. pies) and sopping (eg. <a href="#biscuitsgravy">biscuits & gravy</a>). 
<a href="#cowboybiscuits">Cowboy-style biscuits</a> were rustled up by pioneers and overland travelers in makeshift ovens. <a href="#cathead">Cathead

     <p>
     "Biscuit...The word derives from the Latin words "bis" (twice) plus "coctus"
     (cooked). In
     England a biscuit is what Americans usually call a cracker or cookie. The
     American meaning
     for biscuit was first noted by John Palmer in his <i>Journal of Travels in the United
     States of
     North America, and in Lower Canada</i>,  (1818), and by 1828 Webster defined
     the confection
     as "a composition of flour and butter, made and baked in private families." In
     general usage such
     puffy leavened little breads were called "soda biscuits" or "baking-soda biscuits," in
     contrast to
     the unleavened cracker type....Recipes for soda biscuits are found in every
     nineteenth-century
     cookbook, especially with reference to the cookery of the South...The South is
     also the home of
     the beaten biscuit, which was first mentioned in 1853...In 1930 General Mills
     began selling a
     packaged quick biscuit mix called Bisquick that was a great success and spawned
     many

"There, in the Blackstone kitchen, Berry's grand chefs, Vernie and Floyd Nabors, turned out Sunday morning biscuits that melted in one's mouth. Particularly if you 
opened one up and added fresh butter along with the generous portion of the Berry-made apple butter...One of my classmates put it for me in hushed tones: "What you
 see there, Joe, is what we call the Cathead Bsicuit, the gift of an all-knowing and benevolent God." Mountain people, he explained,  were particularly partial to the 
giant-size biscuits, which were destined by the Almighty to go with milk-enhanced sawmill gravy, another mountain favorite...Indeed the "cathead"--an Applachian 
phenomenon--was the precursor to the even larger size biscuits offered today by chains such as Hardee's and Mrs. Winner's. The big difference between regular-size 
buttermilk biscuits and the catheads was that with most "cats," the cook pinched off handfuls of dough rather than rolling it out and using a biscuit cutter...

"Sawmill gravy (or Logging gravy). In the years following the turn of the century, logging camps sprang up all over the Smoky Mountains where timber companies had 
bought up tracts of virgin timber. Lumberjacks and sawmillers by the hundreds came in to snake out the logs to nearby streams, sawmills, and newly built railheads. 
Entire families moved in with the men to the camps. To feed the multitude was a big challenge. Breakfasts usually consisted of coffee and meat plus flour-based gravies 
and large "cathead" biscuits. On e day, the story goes, the Tremont camp ran out of flour and had to substitute cornmeal in the gravy. Inquisitive loggers arriving before 
breakfast asked what kind of gravy was on the menu that day. "This gravy's made out of sawdust!" the cooks replied. The name stuck. The cheap, easy-to-fix cornmeal 
gravy caught on. While "sawmill gravy" was the popular nickname, some called itn "Logging Gravy." Others named it Poor Do or Life Everlasting, a reference to what many
 felt was its role in keeping them alive. This recipe adapation comes from Janice Miracle of Middlesboro, Kentucky...

<b>ABOUT BISCUITS & GRAVY</b>
<br>
Biscuits and gravy is traditionally connected to the American South. Althought it can be served at
any meal, the most
popular meal  appears to be breakfast. Historic cookbooks contain many recipes for biscuits but
no information with
regards to smothering them with gravy. Perhaps it was "understood." Most cookbooks stress
serving biscuits HOT from
the oven, with butter. We find notes referencing the combination of biscuits and gravy in current
southern-American
cookbooks. Sadly, they do not impart much in the way of history. This book sums it up best:
<p>
"Eggs fried in bacon drippings, escorted by country ham, hot biscuits, grits with butter and
red-eye gravy, and a cup of
coffee so hot that the less acquainted might term it "scalding"--these aren't merely the makings of
a Southern breakfast,
they're the substance of a Southern lifeblood...Southerners can probably thank the English for
their skepticism toward
"fancy" food in general and for the notion that breakfast isn't really breakfast unless it contains
meat and grains--in
quantity. The English colonists brought with them their preference for puddings, porridge, meat
pies, beef, mutton, and
pork. In fact , the appearance of ham on the breakfast plates of Southeners can probably  be
traced to the first pigs that
were carried from England to Jamestown, Virginia in 1608...Even after the Civil War, when many
Southerners were
attempting to modify their image and also their food, pork and pone continued to be inextricably
bound together on many
breakfast tables...The Southern breakfast saw its heyday during the plantation era of the
eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries--when breakfast was the first and most substantial meal of the day. As Southern lore has
it, planation owners
generally would begin the day with a julep or brandy, then inspect the crops, and sit down to a
large breakfast at ten
AM..."<br>

"Gravy implies a certain excess. And a certain economy. Spread butter or jam on a biscuit and you better it. But ladle sawmill gravy on a
biscuit, unitl the crown of that biscuit can barely be seen amid a pool of sausage-pocked gravy, and you transform a quick bread
into a feed suited for plow hands...The Southern way with gravies as born of privation...And when folks are poor they make do. 
Which means folks make gravy."<br>

Madras okra gravy, Oyster gravy, Roan Mountain Corn gravy, Sawmill Gravy, & Sopping chocolate (aka Chocolate gravy).]
<p>
"Red-eye gravy served with ham and grits is arguably the most "Southern" of any Southern
breakfast combination. The
origin of the name of this gravy, however, is somewhat mythical. According to one theory,
Andrew Jackson once asked a
cook for gravy as red as the cook's eyes. Another source purports that the appearance of a "red
eye" in the middle of a
pan of a correctly made ham gravy reduction is what gives this sauce its name. The propular way
to make it is perhaps
equally contentious...Served on hot toasted cornbread, this makes a delightful breakfast."<br>

<a name="milkgravy">
<b>About milk gravies</b><br>
Sauce/gravy recipes were introduced to the New World by European settlers. These ranged from
very simple fat & flour
combinations to complicated French reductions. Milk/cream based gravy [aka white gravy] was
among the simpler
concoctions. This vesatile gravy  adapted easily to "ingredients at hand" which made them popular
with folks facing hard
times.  They were quick to make, easy to store, added flavor to otherwise basic foods, and filled
the belly. Milk gravy
recipes appear in American cookbooks from colonial days to present. This evidence suggests they 
were not "invented"
during the Civil War. They were, however, likely adapted to incorporate whatever ingredients
were available at the time.
In modern times, milk gravy was sometimes made with manufactured products, such as
dried/canned milk or cream. As
with most gravy/sauce recipes, there are dozens of variations.
<p>
<b>About milk gravy in Kentucky</b><p>
"Even the name [sawmill gravy] suggests poverty. By some accountis, it derives from the fact that
sawmill crews often
subsisted on little more than coffee, biscuits, and gravy. In some parts of Kentucky, this dish was
called poor-do--a little
something on which the poor made do. Native Kentuckian Jane Brock Woodall recalls that her
grandmother in Casey
County made the gravy from sausage or chicken dregs, and when there was not enough food to
go around, the men ate
first and got whatever meat there was and the women and children got by on poor-do. Elsewhere,
people would have
shunned anything called poor-do or even sawmill gravy ate essentially the same thing and called it
white gravy or cream
gravy. By whatever name, it was and is a flavorful and familiar dish on many Southern tables."
---John Eggerton, <i>Southern Food </I>...In the years following the turn of the century, logging

days: then, by adding the

regions. Marlyand Beaten Biscuit recipes are good examples. Food historians trace the practice of "beating" bread to England, possibly
as far back as the 16th century. 
<p>
"Recipe for soda biscuits are found in every nineteeth-century cookbook, especially with reference
to the cookery of the South, where biscuits with ham remain a specialty. The South is also home of
the "beaten biscuit," which was first mentioned in 1853. This curious confection, known in
Maryland as a "Maryland biscuit," is rarely made today, but was once common in the
South,where the sound of a mallet beating the biscuit dough was a nostalgic morning sound."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New
York] 1999 (p. 29)
Mr. Mariani lists the sources he uses in <i>The Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i> at the end
of his
book. The 1853 reference for [Maryland Beaten Biscuits is this:<blockquote>
"1853 (1982) Lea, Domestic Cookery 69: MD, Maryland Biscuit. Rub half a pound of lard into
three pounds
of flour; put in a spoonful of salt, a tea-cup of cream, and water sufficient to make it into a stiff
dough; divide
it into two parts, and work each well till it will break off short, and is smooth; (some pound it
with an iron
hammer, or axe;) cut it up into small pieces, and work them into little round cakes."<br>

"Beaten biscuits are, like grits, very much of a mystery to the uninitiated. They may be the forerunner of the modern
raised biscuit, but these chewy, unleavened morsels resmeble more the hard tack produced by early European bakers for armies
and navies than anything else served up in the modern South. Pilot bread and sea biscuit are terms for similar breads that
reflect their practical use. Country ham was for some time wedded the beaten biscuit in Southern cuisine. At the most traditional
fancy parties and weddings, biscuits no bigger than a quarter are invariably served up with baked, cured ham sliced as 
thin as imaginable sandwiched inside and spiked with mustard. Otherwise, beaten biscuits are rarely seen anymore. They sound
harder to make than they are...those  who enjoy a physical relationship with their doughs should be in heaven here. There is
no getting around the activity. Fifteen minutes of heavy, consistent abuse is the minimum. You can use a rolling pin, a hammer, the
side of an axe; whatever, it must be heavy...In the old days, the dough was beaten on a tree stump in the yard. When properly
beaten, the dough will blister at each blow. it will develop a strange plastic quality and be smoother than any other bread 
dough you have ever seen...The biscuits, when done, will be dry throughout, yet soft in the middle."<br>
---<i>Biscuits, Spoonbread, and Sweet Potato Pie</i>, Bill Neal [Alfred A. Knopf:New York] 1996 (p. 39)

<p>
Culinary evidence confirms beaten biscuits (aka Maryland Beaten Biscuits,
Maryland
Biscuits, Apoquiniminc Cakes, Hard Biscuits) predate 1853. Early recipes required butter and likely produced specimens 
similar to plain biscuits (sugarless sugar cookies). Mid-19th century recipes employed lard, an economical alternative. 
This would have produced a cruder product, a little lighter than hard tack.
What an interesting declination of food preparation!

"Beaten Biscuits</b><br>
Beaten biscuits originated in Maryland more than 200 years ago, when a mixture of soda and
cream of tartar was used as leavening. The dough was beaten to make it light and airy. These
biscuits became such a necessity that a machine similar to a wringer was invented to manipulate
the dough. Even in modern times, this type of biscuit dough is still beaten. By tradition the dough
is beaten with a hammer, mallet, or an ax for about 30 minutes.  Lard was originally used in the
biscuit dough, but today either solid vegetable shortening, margarine, or butter is often
substituted.<p>
<i>Makes 3 1/2 to 4 dozen biscuits</i><br>
4 cups all-purpose flour<br>
1 teaspoon baking powder<br>
1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
1 teaspoon sugar <br>
1/2 cup lard, solid vegetable shortening, margarine, or butter<br>
1/3 cup milk combined with 1/3 cup water<br>
Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a bowl. Cut in the shortening until it
resembles coarse meal. Add just enough of the liquid, a little at a time, to make a stiff dough.
Knead the dough several times in the bowl and then turn it out on a lightly floured board. Beat the
dough for about 30 minutes, turning it several times until it pops and is smooth and elastic. Shape
the dough into smooth balls by hand. Place on a cookie sheet and prick each biscuit with a fork,
making 3 rows of holes. Make in a preheated 400 degree F. Oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until
light brown."<br>

"...speaking of revolutionary changes! Lately the routine of the housewife...has been completely altered by the placing upon the
market of a product of Ballard & Ballard of Louisville, Ky., known as Oven Ready Buttermilk Biscuit. This biscuit is all ready 
to bake. The busy housewife simply removes the biscuits from a specially prepared container and plots them into an oven
which would have a temperature of 500 degrees. In eight or ten minutes the biscuits can be removed, baked to a golden brown and
ready for devouring. The dough can be kept on hand for about two weeks, the only requirement being that the biscuits be kept in
the refrigerator...A few years ago there lived in Bowling Green, Ky.--a junction point for three of the Old Reliable's divisions, 
the Louisville, the Nashville and the Memphis Line--a gentleman and incidentally the hero of our story...by the name of L. B. Willoughby. 
Mr. Willoughby was a master baker there and his chief distinction from other men was the fact that his profession was also his
holiday. Generally, Mr. Willoughby was known as 'the experimenter.' At this time he had given to the public, as has been hinted, 
many choice yum-yums, a seed roll in particular...Being mechanically-minded--an expert with the drawing as well as the bread
board--he had invented a flour-sifter for use in bakeries, besides many other gadgets best known to the trade. Mr. Willoughby,
like all other bakers, was well aware of the fact that in winter his business went into a considerable tail spin. This, of course,
was due to the circumstance that in perspirationless season people were more apt to lover lovingly over their own ovens. He had long
had a yen to woo some of this business back into the fold and, for obvious reasons, an oven ready biscuit seemed to him to be just
the thing to do this trick. Bakery baked biscuits had never been a howling success because of the fact that a biscuit to 
deserve three rousing cheers must be served piping hot. But if biscuit dough could be fixed so that it could be kept several days
and still used--ak! that was another matter. Mr. Willoughby went to work on the problem. For quite quite a period of time he confined
his experimenting in this field. One day his patience was rewarded. A batch of dough that he had specially prepared a week or so
before and had since kept refrigerated when cut up into biscuits and placed inb an oven turned into somethign a few minutes later
that went very well with butter and honey...He called his discovery the Olde Kentucky Buttermilk Biscuit and placed it on 
the market. Ten of the biscuits were placed in each container, each biscuit being separated from its neighbors by a piece of
foil and oiled paper. On the label adorning the container purchasers were given simple instructions on how to bake...
Ballard's took over Mr. Willoughby's  brain-child on January 22 of this year...The flour people prepared to capture the country in
the name of the Oven Ready Biscuit, city by city. Indianapolis was the first to fall through vigorous advertising via
newspapers, billboards and store window displays."<br>

How were refrigerator biscuits invented? Food historians trace the path from accidental mess to the Pillsbury Doughboy:
<p>
"The story of Pillsbury's refrigerator dough begins in 1930 with a baker in Louisville, Kentucky. Lively Willoughboy, as he was called, sliced and stacked unbaked 
biscuits, wrapped them in foil, and packed them in cardboard tubes before storing them in an icebox. When the compressed dough was removed from the icebox, it 
exploded, converting the Willoughby kitchen into a shooting gallery. Lively's son had to stand on a ladder to scrape the dough off the ceiling with a putty knife. 
Consistent efforts by Lively to eliminate the explosive character of his refrigerated dough eventually paid off and he sold his process to the Ballard and Ballard 
Flour Company. Pillsbury obtained this process in 1952 when it acquired Ballard. Pillsbury launched its crescent rolls in 1965, first approaching Leo Burnett, its ad 
agency, which came up with the idea of the animated Pillsbury Doughboy. Poppin' Fresh, a revolutionary figure in advertising, laucnhed the crescent rolls in 1965
 and went on to symbolize Pillbury's products in a vast number of commercials."<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of Consumer Brands</i>, Volume 1: Consumable Products, Janice Jorgensen editor [St. James Press:Dover] 1994 (p. 454)
<p>
"In 1951 Pillsbury bought Ballard & Ballard, which owned a process for storing refrigerated dough in cardboard tubes. The process was invented by a Louisville, 
Kentucky, baker in 1930 and refined over the years. The acquisition of Ballard & Ballard marked Pillsbury's entry into the refrigerated dough market, which 
became a company mainstay. The launch in 1965 of refrigerated crescent rolls coincided with the debut of the Pillsbury Doughboy, as well as the signature tag line,
 "Nothing says lovin' like something from the oven,"..."<br>
---<i>Advertising Age Encyclopedia of Advertising</i>, John McDonough ed. [Fitzroy Dearborn:New York] Volume 3, 2003 (p. 1235)
<p>
"Federal Judge Roy Shelbourne ruled today that any manufacturer is free to use the Ballard and Ballard Company patent for oven-ready biscuits. Shelbourne also
 held that the Borden Company, a rival in the sale of canned biscuits ready to pop into the oven for baking, was innocent of copying the label and package design 
of the Ballard product. Ballard and Ballard, now owned by Pillsbury Mills, Inc., Minneapolis, had sued the Borden Company and its west-coast distributer, 
Ready-to-Bake Foods, Inc. alledging infringement of patent and unfair-trade practices in copying its package. Kraft Foods, Inc., Chicago, had intervened on the 
Ballard side as its west-coast distributor. On the patent angle, Judge Shelbourne held the original patent, issued in 1931, had expired after seventeen years and a
 new patent obtained in 1948 did not contain enough additional new ingredients or methods to make it valid..."<br>

     <p>
<p>
Our survey of historic newspapers suggest "Graham crackers" (aka Graham wafers) were known by the early 1870s. We find references
to manufactured products. Presumably Graham flour items were also made at home. Earliest allusions likened Graham Crackers
to ships' biscuit. These hardy foodstuffs (think hardtack) were better known for their dietary function and economical properties than 
flavor or savor. This makes sense, because Graham's followers advocated a spartan approach to diet. It was not until 
mass 20th century commercialism that Graham Crackers (like <a href="foodsandwiches.html#aboutpeanutbutter">peanut butter</a>) crossed over from health prescription to popular food. Dr. Graham would NOT have appreciated
the <a href="#chocolategrahams">chocolate-coated versions</a> some people enjoy today.
<p>
<b>What was Graham flour"</b><p>
"Graham flour. An unsifted whole-wheat flour containing the bran of the wheat kernel (1825). It is named after Reverend Sylvester 
Graham (1794-1851), a tenacious advocate of temperance, healthy nutrition, and the virtues of home baking with this kind of 
flour...Graham sent up 'Graham hotels' serving strictly controlled meals quite in line with the belief of the temperance movement that 
food should not contain any stimulants...Graham began is crusade in 1830, within four years people were talking of 
'Graham bread.' by 1882 a flat, slightly sweet cookie called a 'graham cracker' was well known...Graham's legacy survives today 
mostly in the form of the cookies named after him..." <br>
---<i>The Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1999 (p. 143)
<p>
"The Graham crackers, upon which we principally existed, were baked hard and dry like sea biscuit, and we found it necessary to
moisten and soften them before eating, and we resorted to the use of boiling hot water, breaking the crackers into it, and 
allowing them to absorb all the water they would."<br>

<b>Who was Dr. Sylvester Graham?</b><br>
A New England health advocate with a passion for temperance and fiber.
<p>
"Sylvester Graham. His name lives on in a nursery cookie, but Sylvester Graham, one of America's earliest and most vocal advocates 
of dietary reform, left a far larger legacy: the concept that a vegetarian diet of natural and largely raw foods--whole grains, 
vegetables, fruits, and nuts--can restore and maintain health. Graham campaigned for pure, unadulterated food at a time when baker's 
bread might contain copper sulfate, plaster, or alum. And in an era predating scientific knowledge of carbohydrates, protein, 
fat, and fiber, he insisted that processing, milling, sifting, and overcooking stripped food of its most important 
components. Although mocked in his day, Graham's theories foreshadowed much modern nutritional knowledge." <br>
---<i>Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America</i>, Andrew F. Smith editor [Oxford University Press:New York] 2004, volume 1 
(p. 573) 
<p>
"Graham's recommendations came at a time when America's diet consisted largely of corn, pork, molasses, puddings, and pies, with potatoes cooked in lard...Early 
in his speaking career Graham seized upon the sorry state of commercial bread that had begun to enter the New England 
marketplace after the 1830's. In his Treatise on Bread and Bread-Making (1837), Graham advocated homemade brown bread made 
of unbolted flour and bran instead of light, thin-crusted loaves then being sold which he condemned for being adulterated with 
unwholesome fillers and additives." <br>

<b>The Nabisco factor</b> <br>
Although Nabisco (formerly the National Biscuit company) was not the first and/or only 
company to manufacture graham crackers, it is often credited with introducing them to the American 
public for mass-production. The National Biscuit Company was formed at the very end of the 19th 
century. This passage is from a corporate biography: 
<p>
"Another NBC [National Biscuit Company, later Nabisco] product, the graham cracker, was also 
popular throughout the country. It had been a favorite since it was created and introduced in the 
early part of the nineteenth century by Dr. Sylvester Graham, an eccentric but sagacious expert 
on health foods...The graham cracker had been sold by bakeries for decades. The New York Biscuit 
Company and its rivals to the west all sold it. However, it remained for the National Biscuit 
Company to stabilize its production, package it, and give it national promotion." <br>

were hard, others were soft. Many employed traditional English spices of nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves. Raisins and 
nuts were often added for flavor and texture. Molasses replaced refined <a href="foodcandy.html#refined">cane sugar</a> for economic reasons. According to culinary legend, Joe Froggers belong to this venerable 
confectionery genre. Joe�s *secret ingredient* was rum. 
<p>
<b>Who was Joe Frogger?</b><br>
No one knows, for sure. This is a prime example of what food historians call "culinary legend," or "fakelore." If a story sounds plausible, and
is circulated widely enough, it becomes "truth."
<p>
�Joe Frogger. A thick New England cookie spiced with ginger, nutmeg, cloves, and other spices. The origins of the name are 
unknown, though the most often cited story concerns an old man named �Uncle Joe� who lived near a frog pond in Marblehead,
 Massachusetts. He loved rum and always put it into his cookies, which resembled the frogs in the pond. The cookies are a 
traditional Sunday-night snack in New England.�<br>
---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1999 (p. 172)
<p>
�A long time ago there was an old Negro who lived in Marblehead. His name was Uncle Joe and he lived on the edge of a frog 
pond, and the pond was called Uncle Joe�s Frog Pond. Uncle Joe made the best molasses cookies of anyone in town, and 
people called them Joe Froggers because they were as plump and as dark as the little fat frogs that lived in the pond. 
Marblehead fishermen would give the old man a jug of rum and he would make them a batch of Froggers. The fishermen liked 
them because they never got hard, and women packed them in 
sea chests for the me to take to sea. Uncle Joe said what kept them soft was rum and sea water but he wouldn�t tell how he 
made them. And when he died, people said, �That�s the end of Joe Froggers.� But there was a woman named Mammy Cressy, who 
said she was Uncle Joe�s daughter, and Mammy Cressy gave the secret recipe to a fisherman�s wife. Then half the women in 
Marblehead began making Joe Froggers. With a pitcher of milk, Froggers became the town�s favorite Sunday night supper. 
They were also sold in a local bake shop. Children bought them, instead of candy, for a penny apiece, and they remained
 popular for generations. Joe Froggers, 6 inches in diameter, are made almost every day in the old Village Tavern in
 Sturbridge, and on Sunday nights they are served with a pitcher of milk, in the Publick House. The chef got the recipe 
from a woman whose ancestors lived in Marblehead in the days of Uncle Joe. The recipe has been in her family for more than
 a hundred years.�<br>
---<i>New England Cookbook</i>, Eleanor Early [Random House:New York] 1954 (p. 166-7)<br>
[NOTE: Early's recipe <a href="#froggerrecipe">here</a>.]
<p>
�Today a private residence, it was once a popular neighborhood tavern run by "Black Joe," a free black man who had fought
 in the Revolutionary War, and his wife, Aunt Crese. For the half-century following the Revolution, they served rum and 
homemade root beer to the Marblehead fishermen and their families who climbed the hill to dance to Black Joe's fiddling 
and to munch on Aunt Crese's Joe Froggers, plate-sized ginger cookies laced with rum.�<br>

<p>
ARE JOE FROGGERS [FLOGGERS] REALLY HUNDREDS OF YEARS OLD?</b><br>
The legend is quaint, but print culinary evidence does not support the existence in colonial days. Just like 
<a href="#snickerdoodles">Snickerdoodles</a>. We can confirm similar recipes but not molasses cookies with rum. Of course, the Pilgrim fathers did not 
approve of alcohol. Neither did the early temperance folks/cookbook authors, like Catharine Beecher. It is quite possible 
folks snuck the ingredient in long before it was recorded in books. Sandra Oliver, food historian with notable expertise 
in 19th century New England fare states this:
<p>
�Joe floggers: The earliest reference I have found to this familiar-sounding item dates from 1852 and speaks of Joe 
floggers with an �l.� An 1889 citation describes �Joe-Floggers (peculiar pancakes stuffed with plums) for breakfast�--that
 is, pancakes with raisins in them. Joe-froggers with an �r� simply didn�t exist or were not widespared enough in the
 nineteenth century to be found in imprint or manuscript sources by that name. They seem to be a twentieth-century 
phenomenon, possibly derived from fishermen�s �floggers.��<br>
---<i>Saltwater Foodways: New Englanders and ther Food, at Sea and Ashore, in the Nineteenth Century</i>, Sandra L. Oliver [Mystic Seaport Museum:Mystic CT] 1995 (p. 138)
<p>
The oldest print evidence (including recipe) we find for Joe Froggers dates to 1954. Both credit Old Sturbridge Village (Sturbridge MA)as the
for re-introducing this "old fashioned" cookie to modern American tourists. OSV re-creates an 1830s New England village. Whatever the truth, whoever decided to sell 
Joe Froggers was brilliant. No better way to experience history than by tasting it.
<p>
"Old Sturbridge Village is a slice out of yesterday. Nestled there on the banks of the little Quinebaug River in southern
Massachusetts, this 200-acre tract of unspoiled countryside is a New England Williamsburg...The Place I loved best was Minor Grant's store--
it drew me in by the nose. Cookies were baking, the old-time favorites: hobnails, lumberjacks... and those bog Joe
Froggers."<br>

     <font size="4" color="#003366"><b>Sugar cookies, Jumbles & <a
     href="#sugarcakes">American sugar
     cakes</a></b></font>
     <p>
     Food historians trace the history of these cookies and cakes to Medieval Arab
     cuisine, which was
     rich in <a href="foodcandy.html#aboutsugar">sugar</a>. Small sugar cakes with
     nuts (most
     often almonds) and spices were known to these
     cooks and quickly adopted by the Europeans. This sweet culinary tradition was
     imported by the Moors to Spain, diffused and assimilated throughout Europe, then
     introduced to
     the New World by 16th century explorers. The primary differences between
     English sugar cookies
     and their <a
     href="#mexicanweddingcakes">continental counterparts</a> were the spices, use
     of nuts (lacking
     in English versions), and shapes.
     <p>
     In English cookbooks, precursors to sugar cookies were known by many names,
     most often: 
     jumbal, jumble,  jambal, jemelloe, gemmel. Jumbals were hard spiced biscuits. They
     were baked
     thick to make them suitable for journeys and could be stored for about a year.
     They were also
     typically twisted into knots, presumably to make them a little easier to break and
     eat.
     <p>
     "Jumbles...sometimes called knots, a type of biscuit popular in the 17th and 18th
     centuries. They
     were made from a light mixture of butter, sugar, eggs, and flour, flavoured with
     rosewater and
     aniseed or caraway seed. The mixture was made into thin rolls and shaped into
     rounds or knots
     before baking; the name derives from gemmel, twin, here referring to a double
     intertwined finger
     ring."<br>
     ---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University
     Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 423)
<p>
"Jumbals existed in Italy as cimbelline and in France as gimblettes, all manifestly related words. The pastry may have
originated in Italy, but I believe that Favre is in error when he assigns cimabetta...as the etymology of gimblette... He
also gives what he claims to be an ancient recipe from Albi which calls for parboiling the gimblettes afer "pricking the well,"
 then baking them; also some old recipes for echaudes call for ring shapes. The first citing of jumbal in OED [Oxford English
Dictionary] is from Markham, 1615, but Dawson gives a recipe in 1585, <i>To make Jombils a hundred</i>...Also, in <i>The
Accomplisht Cook</i>, 1671, Robert May gives recipes for Jemelloes and Jamballs, which he directs us to "boil them in fair water like
simnels" before baking them. This makes jumbals originally related in technique to other ancient cakes such as cracknells...and to the 
breads pretzels and bagels, for that matter."<br>
---<i>Martha Washington's Booke of Cookery</i>, transcribed by Karen Hess [Columbia University Press:New York] 1995 (p. 349)<br>

     <p>
     Robert May's <i>The Accomplist Cook</i> (London, 5th edition, 1685) contains
     this recipe,
     which is probably quite similar to the one that the original Mayflower passengers
     used:
     <p><blockquote>
     <b>"To make Jambals</b><br>
     Take a pint of fine wheat flour, the yolks of three or four new laid eggs, three or
     four spoonfuls of
     sweet cream, a few anniseeds, and some cold butter, make it into paste, and roul it
     into long rouls,
     as big as a little arrow, make them into divers knots, then boil them in fair water
     like simnels; bake
     them, and being baked, box them and keep them in a stove. Thus you may use
     them, and keep
     them all year." (p. 275)
</blockquote>
<p>
Compare with Martha Washington's Recipes
<blockquote>
<b>"To Make Iumbals</b><br>
Take a pound & a halfe of fine flowre & a pound of fine sugar, both searced & dried in an oven, 6 youlks, & 3 whites of eggs, 6
spoonfulls of sweet cream & as much rose water, fresh butter ye quantety of an egg. Mingle these together & make it into stiff
paste. Work it a quarter of an hour then break it abroad, & put in as much annyseeds or carraway seeds as you shall think fit, 
& put in A little muske & ambergreece. roule them into rouls & make them in what forms you please. lay them on pie plates thin buttered,
& prick them with holes all over. then bake them as you doe diet bread. If this quantety of eggs will not be enough to wet ye flour
& sugar, put in 23 or 4 more, but no more cream, butter, not rosewater."

And this twentieth century rendering:

<b>"Jumbles (American Recipe)</b><br>
Ingredients.--14 ozs. of flour. 5 ozs. of sugar, 3 ozs. of butter, 1 eg, the finely-grated rind and juice of 1 lemon, 3 teaspoonfuls of milk, 1 teaspoonful of cream of tartar, 1/2 a teaspoonful of carbonate of soda.
Method.--Beat the butter and sugar to a cream, add the egg, milk, lemon-juice, and rind. Sieve the flour, cream of tartar, and soda, and miz with the other ingredients. Roll out rather thinly and cut into rounds, or cut into long, narrow strips, which, after being lightly pressed into a round shape with the palm of the hand, should be wound round and round to form small cakes.

     <b>American sugar cakes</b><br>
     American "sugar cakes" appear to be an iteration of the English <a
     href="#sugarcookies">jumble</a>, without the fancy shape. Here are some early
     American
     recipes:
     <p><blockquote>
     <b>[1750s?]<br>

     "Take 3 ale quarts of fine flowre, & put to it a pound of sugar, beaten & searced,;

     [NOTES: (1) Ms. Hess adds these observations: "We now come to a section of
     baked cakes,
     starting off with what Americans would call cookies. This is an excellent recipe for
     sugar cookies,
     really sand tarts. The dough will not actually rise, but even a short period of rest
     permits a
     maturing and fermentation that improve texture and flavor...A note on the word
     flour. It comes
     from French fleur de farine, flower of meal...Flour and flower were not
     differentiated until the
     eighteenth century..."ibid. P. 309-10 (2) this book contains two more recipes for
     sugar cakes.]

     <b>[1825]<br>

     Three pounds of flour, sifted.<br>
     One pound of butter.<br>
     A pound and a half of powdered sugar.<br>
     Half a pint of milk.<br>
     Two tablespoons full of brandy.<br>
     A small tea-spoonful of pearl-ash dissolved in water.<br>
     Four table-spoonfuls of carraway seeds.<br>
     Cut the butter into the flour. Add the sugar and carraway seeds. Pour in the
     brandy, and then the
     milk. Lastly, put in the pearl-ash. Stir all well with a knife, and mix it thoroughly,
     till it becomes a
     lump of dough. Flour your paste-board and lay the dough on it. Knead it very well.
     Divide it into
     eight or ten pieces, and knead each piece separately. Then put them all together,
     and knead them
     very well in one lump. Cut the dough in half, and roll it out into sheets, about half
     an inch thick.
     Beat the sheets of dough very hard, on both sides, with the rolling-pin. Cut them
     out into round
     cakes with the edge of a tumbler. Butter iron pans, and lay the cakes in them. Bake
     them of a very
     pale brown. If done too much they will lose their taste. These cakes kept in a stone
     jar, closely
     covered from the air, will continue perfectly good for several months."<br>
