    <div class="entry">
    <p>I&#8217;ve previously mentioned one of the biggest drawbacks of a reformist approach to implementing <a href="http://www.thephilosophyofliberty.com/">libertarian ethics</a> is that <a href="http://bradspangler.com/blog/archives/1464">politics makes you stupid</a> &#8212; because by looking at things in terms of government policy, <strong>you tend to lose the ability to explain and advocate something very important</strong>. Now <a href="http://aaeblog.com/2010/05/19/electoral-race/">Rand Paul is getting his nose</a> <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/taylor-marsh/rand-paul-on-civil-rights_b_582674.html">rubbed in it</a> &#8212; and I&#8217;m quite pleased by this, because electoral politics is a wrong turn for the libertarian movement and the sooner libertarians realize this the better.</p>
<p>That something is this&#8230;</p>
<p>Libertarian ethics add another layer to thought about society, by describing the circumstances when violence is appropriate and when it isn&#8217;t (as well as by contributing the related recognition that the state is institutionalized violence). By focusing solely on what state policy ought and ought not be, what gets ignored is the ability to build <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_law">positive law</a> in a stateless society. Positive law in a statist society is tyrannical because it is imposed coercively. Positive law in a stateless society would be libertarian &#8212; built contractually and through free association in response to non-violent methods of persuasion.</p>
<p>In other words, the serious libertarian (i.e. <a href="http://agorism.info/">agorist</a>) recognizes <strong>not only</strong> that social evils such as racism ought to be opposed, but that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle">an important principle</a> must shape the <em>character</em> of that opposition &#8212; resulting in use of either violent or non-violent means as may be appropriate to the particular case under consideration.</p>

    <p>If government had traditionally held a monopoly of shoe manufacture and distribution, advocating abolition of that monopoly would NOT mean you don&#8217;t realize the importance of shoes, would NOT mean you&#8217;re anti-shoe and would NOT mean you hate the poor and don&#8217;t want them to have shoes.</p>
<p>Rather, it would indicate the advocate of open competition is aware of some things others are not:</p>
<p>1) That attempting to order society by means of systematic death threats and calling it &#8220;law&#8221; has nothing to do with shoes and everything to do with exploitation by a ruling class.</p>
<p>2) That shoe policy doesn&#8217;t have to be something society divides up into political parties to constantly war back and forth about.</p>
<p>3) That we can have plenty of shoes if we give slavery the boot.</p>

    <div class="entry">
    <p>Proximity is a two-way relationship but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism">Georgists</a> attempt to use it to justify a one-way transfer of wealth. Real estate prices are, indeed, largely a matter of location &#8212; but there&#8217;s no way to argue that one&#8217;s proximity to the rest of the community creates an obligation to reimburse the community, since the community also derives value from people (such as one&#8217;s self) being in proximity to it.</p>
<p>Me being close to you necessarily implies that you, likewise, are close to me. There&#8217;s no getting around that for Georgists. Sorry.</p>

    <div class="entry">
    <p>For your review and critique, some followup on <a href="http://bradspangler.com/blog/archives/1574">this post</a> &#8212; a snippet of conversation from this morning on Facebook:</p>
<p>A correspondent:</p>
<blockquote><p>The whole notion of ‘rights’ is absurd — ‘ethics’ is a function of human emotion, and not of logic or reasoning or ‘truth.’</p></blockquote>
<p>Myself:</p>
<blockquote><p>While the matter of what people might individually value is subjective (as well as their ordinal preferences among values), whether or not a value has been attained is a yes or no question.</p>
<p><strong>I want a ham sandwich.</strong> <em>That&#8217;s a subjective preference.</em> <strong>Do I have a ham sandwich?</strong> <em>No. That&#8217;s a fact.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Correspondent:</p>
<blockquote><p>Does that have anything to do with ‘rights?’</p></blockquote>
<p>Myself:</p>
<blockquote><p>If &#8220;good&#8221; contra &#8220;bad&#8221; is understood to mean, in a secular sense, achieving/maximising the attainment of values (not merely in a sense of literal material goods, but the goals of any goal directed action) among the population generally&#8230;</p>
<p>Then there *is* an empirical basis for the concept that development of a consensus on bounds of behavior that don&#8217;t overlap (spheres of free action, or &#8220;rights&#8221;) is &#8220;good&#8221;.</p>
<p>Either values get achieved or they don&#8217;t. That the basis of value selection is subjective has no relevance to the factual question of whether or not goals/values are being achieved.</p></blockquote>
<p>Correspondent:</p>
<blockquote><p>The point, though, is that ethics is still necessarily just a function of human sentiment — no meta-ethical theory can save us from this. Why? … you can&#8217;t adopt one meta-ethical theory over another … except by comparing how well they align with your own personal sentiments. A disagreement in matters of ‘ethics’ is more like a disagreement over what type of art is more beautiful than a disagreement over a question that actually has some type of logically true answer (like, say, mathematics).</p></blockquote>
<p>Myself:</p>
<blockquote><p>re: &#8220;you can&#8217;t adopt one meta-ethical theory over another … except by comparing how well they align with your own personal sentiments.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think I just sketched a basis for how you can. Perhaps you can show me my error.</p>
<p>Either people are achieving their values or they aren&#8217;t (i.e. either they&#8217;re free or they aren&#8217;t &#8212; although not exactly the same thing, we can treat it that way for now).</p>
<p>Perhaps they *are* achieving values I disapprove of.</p>
<p>From an evolutionary standpoint, a framework of maximising attainment of values by the species (or population of allied species) generally would seem to trump my own personal preferences for which values other people ought to be seeking.</p></blockquote>
<p>A different correspondent:</p>
<blockquote><p>I really don&#8217;t want to get into this debate, but then how is one to decide a sense of value based on those sentiments. For example if a group of people sincerely want to kill a set of X people for an arbitrary feature. Would you not say this desire/emotion is less valuable than a group of people who want to feed the hungry?</p></blockquote>
<p>Myself:</p>
<blockquote><p>Clearly the people being killed are not achieving their values.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>It just doesn&#8217;t seem all that controversial to me that maximising value/goal attainment among a population generally is done by development of a social consensus on bounds of behavior to minimize conflicting behavior.</p></blockquote>
<p>A third correspondent:</p>
<blockquote><p>If I could achieve all my values by convincing others that they are objective, I would gladly do it, but that still wouldn&#8217;t make it so.</p></blockquote>
<p>Myself:</p>
<blockquote><p>But I&#8217;m not asserting that values are objective &#8212; only that it&#8217;s an objective fact that they have been attained or not in any given case.</p></blockquote>

    <div class="entry">
    <p>Individual rights or natural rights are just as &#8220;real&#8221; as the number pi. It&#8217;s a concept that describes a fundamental aspect of reality &#8212; that among a collection of autonomous agents, specific boundaries to the scope of available actions are conducive to the flourishing of the entire collective. Just because something is intangible doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not real.</p>
<p>You won&#8217;t find &#8220;natural rights&#8221; or the number pi in the periodic table of the elements &#8212; but both bridges and societies will stand or fall based on how well such intangible aspects of reality are understood.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Do you really believe that if we were to topple the current administration or government (which won&#8217;t happen), people would agree to re-establish it with nothing?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I took &#8220;<em>people would agree to re-establish it with nothing</em>&#8221; to mean &#8220;<em>people [generally] wouldn&#8217;t re-establish a government?</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>My reply:</p>
<blockquote><p>You apparently have me confused with Clark Kent if you don&#8217;t realize the only way I could, myself, conceivably topple the government is by convincing enough people to make themselves ungovernable by *any* government in the first place.</p></blockquote>

    <div class="entry">
    <p>I am considering putting the below text together as a handout for the Tea Party crowd. Ideas? Suggestions? Criticism?</p>
<blockquote><p>
A CHALLENGE TO THE TEA PARTIES: EMBRACE THE CLASS STRUGGLE</p>
<p>To the grassroots members of the tea parties,</p>
<p>Many of you are rightly angry over the U.S. government&#8217;s health care bill that was recently passed despite massive public opposition. Big Business lobbied to get this awful legislation through. They aim to get wealthy at your expense, using awful government policies, and tax dollars taken from you against your will, to make you buy their product &#8212; at gunpoint, figuratively speaking.</p>
<p>This so-called health care bill is top-down class warfare. Isn&#8217;t it time you started fighting back?</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not talking about the old, worn out Marxist idea of class struggle between simply the rich and the poor. The real class struggle is between the makers and the takers. The makers are you &#8212; the productive class, both workers and honest business people. The takers are the politically favored elite, from both government and business, that get rich by means of special favors from the government and tax dollars. The takers can also be called the political class. They&#8217;re parasites. They don&#8217;t earn their wealth. They use government to take it from the makers, the productive class.</p>
<p>Both major political parties work for the political class. Regular politics won&#8217;t fix this problem. Regular politics made this problem. Remember how many Republicans voted for the bank and auto bailouts? You can&#8217;t trust a Republican not to double-cross you once they get elected.</p>
<p>What should be done, since regular protests get ignored by the politicians and voting won&#8217;t help?</p>
<p>Go over the politicians heads to the people they really work for &#8212; the political class. In the case of the health care bill, we&#8217;re talking about the heads of insurance companies that stand to make enormous artificial profits from the awful legislation. They brought this upon you. It&#8217;s their fault. They made it happen. You can find out who they are. Do your own research. Do some digging.</p>
<p>We suggest targeting both senior management and controlling investors of such companies with non-violent civil resistance campaigns. Below, you&#8217;ll find a list of 198 methods of non-violent action useful for radical campaigns of any sort. Give &#8216;em hell. Tell them to have their bought-and-paid-for pet politicians back off.</p>

    <div class="entry">
    <p>Republished from the US DoD&#8217;s Air University Review, March-April 1980<br />
<a href="http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1980/mar-apr/rejai.html">http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1980/mar-apr/rejai.html</a></p>
<p>The Professional Revolutionary: A Profile</p>
<p>Dr. Mostafa Rejai</p>
<p>A UNIQUE phenomenon of the twentieth century, the professional revolutionary provides an endless source of fascination for both scholarly and popular imagination. Observers with a romantic outlook portray the professional revolutionary as pure, virtuous, and idealist&#8211;as a heroic fighter for humanity, freedom, and justice. Those with a cynical cast of mind see the professional revolutionary as fanatical, psychopathic, and criminal&#8211;as a failure in a society the complete destruction of which alone would yield proper revenge. As we shall see, however, neither view is valid.</p>
<p>The genesis of the concept of professional revolutionary is found in Lenin (What Is To Be Done? 1902), who was also the first to personify it. Lenin defined the primary need of a revolutionary movement in terms of a secret, small, tightly knit, highly disciplined organization of professional revolutionaries&#8211;that is, men who devote their entire life to revolution, who turn revolution into a calling, a vocation, a mission.</p>
<p>The nationalist and revolutionary movements of the twentieth century have catapulted into prominence a host of professional revolutionaries in addition to Lenin. What do these diverse men have in common, and why/how did they become professional revolutionaries?</p>
<p>This, treatment of the professional revolutionary derives from a much larger study of 64 prominent revolutionary leaders from 12 major revolutions of the past. These revolutions occurred in England (1640s), America (1776), France (1789), Mexico (1910), Russia (1917), China (1949), Bolivia (1952), North Vietnam (1954), Hungary (1956), Cuba (1959), Algeria (1962), and France (1968).</p>
<p>Among the 64 leaders are 14 individuals who meet the requirement for professional revolutionary. They are Nikolai Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Leon Trotsky, and Grigori Zinoviev of Russia; Chu Teh, Lui Shao-ch&#8217;i, Lin Piao, and Mao Tse-tung of China; Ho Chi Minh, Le Duan, Troung Chinh, and Vo Nguyen Giap of North Vietnam; Fidel Castro and Ernesto Guevara of Cuba. There are undoubtedly other professional revolutionaries, but these fourteen individuals are the basis for a composite profile in the pages that follow. It goes without saying that not every individual embraces every trait identified.</p>
<p>THE professional. revolutionary is born in an urban setting or, if born in a rural area, experiences early and sustained exposure to urban life. The impulse to revolution, in other words, originates in urban centers, though subsequently it may be &#8220;exported&#8221; to the countryside. The urban milieu introduces the professional revolutionary to a variety of radical ideologies in his late teens or early twenties. By the age of twenty-five, he is virtually certain to have taken actual part in revolutionary agitation and organization.</p>
<p>The professional revolutionary comes from a middle or lower class family with a relatively large number of siblings. Although probability considerations would dictate otherwise, he is more likely to be an oldest or a youngest rather than a middle child. He typically comes from the main ethnic and religious groupings in his society; on occasion, however, he may represent a minority group, most likely Jewish. As time passes, his religious affiliation&#8211;whatever its origins&#8211;takes a sharp turn to atheism.</p>
<p>The professional revolutionary is probably reasonably well educated. This education takes place in public institutions, which brings him into contact with a spectrum of population not found in private or parochial schools. He is almost certain to have gone through high school and quite likely to have had college experience or professional training in such fields as medicine, law, education, the military, or the ministry. Regardless of the nature and extent of his education, the professional revolutionary is likely to be a prolific writer, chiefly on matters of revolutionary theory and practice. As such, he can be labeled an &#8220;intellectual.&#8221;</p>
<p>While his education may qualify him for one of the established professions, the professional revolutionary does not take his occupation seriously. Thus, for example, Lenin obtained a law degree but hardly practiced law; Guevara was a physician who never practiced; and Mao, Ho, and Giap all taught school for only short periods of time. The only exception to this rule is the military profession, which is necessarily taken with utter seriousness. In fact, should he lack formal military training as a requisite component of his skills, the professional revolutionary acquires military experience in the course of the revolution in informal ways.</p>
<p>While there is some likelihood that he participates in established political institutions and processes&#8211;in order either to manipulate or subvert them&#8211;the professional revolutionary is irreversibly committed to radical organization and agitation. He is also quite likely to have a lengthy record of arrest, imprisonment, or exile.</p>
<p>The professional revolutionary is a cosmopolite: he travels widely, gaining extensive exposure to foreign cultures, values, traditions, and languages. This diversity of foreign exposure accounts, in part, for the eclectic nature and origin of the ideology to which the professional revolutionary subscribes. Building on the experiences of his predecessors and counterparts in other societies, synthesizing a variety of beliefs and values, the professional revolutionary adapts foreign ideologies to the conditions and needs of his own country. In general, he is most likely to fuse shades of Marxism (including Marxism-Leninism or communism) with forms of nationalism. When combined, these two doctrines have proved the most explosive revolutionary ideology of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>As a rule, the professional revolutionary is optimistic about the &#8220;nature of man.&#8221; He sees man as basically good and rational but oppressed by and alienated from the society in which he lives. Hence, revolution becomes an act of total liberation.</p>
<p>Similarly, the professional revolutionary maintains a highly positive attitude toward his own country, as his nationalist ideology virtually requires. On the other hand, his image of the international society is dualistic: he sees the world in terms of &#8220;friends&#8221; to be cultivated and &#8220;enemies&#8221; to be fought.</p>
<p>WHAT life experiences account for the emergence of the professional revolutionary?</p>
<p>He probably led a stormy childhood characterized by early rebelliousness, parental conflicts, or loss of one or both parents. He is likely to have been born to a large family, and he tends to be either the oldest or the youngest, son. What accounts for the preponderance of oldest and youngest children among professional revolutionaries? Recent findings in the field of child psychology cast some light on the subject.1</p>
<p>Oldest sons are typically held to strict standards of competence and achievement. As a result, they tend to attain eminence in their chosen endeavors, revolution included. Moreover, oldest sons are likely to experience intense feelings of anxiety over the loss of parental affection/attention once siblings begin to arrive. Coupled with this anxiety are intense feelings of guilt over the hostilities they exhibit toward their siblings. Externalizing and politicizing these feelings of anxiety, hostility, and guilt&#8211;even to the point of revolutionary action&#8211;may be a way of managing one&#8217;s psychic balance.</p>
<p>Youngest children are more striving and defiant toward their siblings&#8211;and probably toward the world in general. They are more competitive and more vigilant in an effort to maintain their status and possessions in the cruel world that a large family may represent. Their perception of relative parental neglect and deprivation may generate impulses toward rebellion. Being highly group-oriented, youngest children may see revolutionary movements as a means of maintaining and augmenting their sense of identity and belongingness.</p>
<p>In contrast to all this, middle children are not subjected to the strict parental codes and norms of behavior that are applied to the first-born. Middle children are better adjusted and satisfied with their lives than either the oldest or the youngest ones. Understandably, they do not seek radical social change.</p>
<p>The professional revolutionary carries the rebelliousness and conflicts of his childhood on to school, where processes of radicalization gain fresh momentum. Exposed to a variety of persons and views but associating mostly with his own kind, he has his horizons broadened, his consciousness enhanced, and his intellectual development gains pace. He is typically found in the forefront of agitation, boycotting classes, leading student strikes, and the like.</p>
<p>The radicalization of the professional revolutionary is completed in foreign travels. He becomes cosmopolitan in many ways: he gains exposure to a variety of cultures and ideologies, personally experiences or witnesses varying modes of oppression and exploitation, shares experiences with other revolutionaries, and develops a set of standards against which to judge his own society.</p>
<p>THE development of the professional revolutionary is also marked by the evolution of a set of psychological attributes. To begin with, the professional revolutionary is driven by a sense of justice/injustice and a corresponding attempt to set things right. This sense of justice/injustice may be personally rooted; it may be perceived in societal conditions, or it may be personally based and projected outward onto the larger society. Whatever form it may take, the sense of justice/injustice is present in a most conspicuous fashion.</p>
<p>The professional revolutionary is motivated by nationalism and patriotism. He may seek to maintain the independence and integrity of his nation. He may set but to free his nation from the oppression and exploitation of another nation. He may wish to improve the status, prosperity, and prestige of his country.</p>
<p>The professional revolutionary is vain, egotistical, &#8216;intent on gaining recognition of his personal superiority. He may have delusions of grandeur, seeing himself as an extraordinary man driven by sublime moral principles and called on by a higher order to bring liberty, equality, and fraternity to humankind. In undertaking all this, the professional revolutionary seeks symbolic immortality.2</p>
<p>The professional revolutionary is ascetic, austere, and puritanical. Self-discipline, self-reliance, self-denial, and relentless emphasis on hard work set him apart from ordinary beings. Accordingly, his demand for &#8220;virtue&#8221; is ceaseless, chronic, and compelling. Evil and corrupt as he finds the existing society, he feels called on to replace sin, greed, and lust with temperance, industry, and purity.</p>
<p>The professional revolutionary tends to be a marginal man in his society, that is, he may deviate in important ways from accepted social norms. This marginality may be physical, social, or psychological. The professional revolutionary may experience bitter personal humiliation, particularly in colonial contexts. He may be scolded in school for being a member of a minority group or coming from a peasant background. Similarly, he may be berated for physical disfigurement of various kinds: unusual features, scarred face, or short stature. In any event, frustrated and humiliated, the professional revolutionary compensates for his marginality by projecting his feelings of inferiority and low self-esteem outward onto the larger society.</p>
<p>The vain, ascetic, austere, marginal professional revolutionary has a gentle side as well: he probably possesses qualities of aestheticism and romanticism. He may be a lover of literature and philosophy (Trotsky, Ho, Guevara), or a lover of poetry (Guevara), or, indeed, he may be a poet in his own right (Mao). He may be a nature lover (Mao). He may have a passion for music (Lenin).</p>
<p>THE professional revolutionary is particularly adept at developing and deploying two elements that are crucial determinants of revolutionary success Of failure: ideology and organization.</p>
<p>Revolutionary ideology has three components: (1) a thorough-going critique of the existing order as inhuman and immoral; (2) a depiction of an alternative, superior order embodying positive values of liberty, equality, and fraternity; and (3) a statement of plans and programs intended to realize the alternative order.</p>
<p>Deploying such an ideology, the professional revolutionary undermines the confidence and morale of the ruling regime, rationalizes and legitimizes the need for revolution, politicizes and mobilizes the masses, enhances the followers&#8217; sense of cohesion and solidarity, and elicits commitment and devotion. He does not adopt an inflexible or purist ideological posture but deliberately dilutes and soft-pedals ideology in order to maximize popular support and make room for maneuver and compromise. He is pragmatic and opportunistic.</p>
<p>Organization is a fundamental adjunct to ideology, the link between ideology and action. The professional revolutionary translates ideology into action thr9ugh the medium of organization. Ide910gy helps &#8220;reach&#8221; the masses; organization functions to tap their energies and channel them toward the realization of revolutionary objectives.</p>
<p>Deploying political, military, and paramilitary organizations, the professional revolutionary eventually launches an offensive on all fronts. He coordinates a program of: (1) maintaining close contacts with the masses; (2) continuing to politicize and mobilize them by means of distributing incentives or punishment, as appropriate; (3) recruiting, socializing, and training cadres and fighters; (4) fighting the battles that need to be fought; (5) gathering maximum intelligence about the enemy; and (6) unleashing a sustained policy of terror and violence that may eventually topple the existing regime.</p>
<p>WHILE the professional revolutionary is a definite personality type, he is neither uniformly noble nor uniformly evil. When combined, the romantic and the cynical views of the professional revolutionary hold a degree of validity. Alone, neither is capable of accounting for this unique phenomenon of our age. The professional revolutionary is a distinctive product of a set of circumstances, a variety of complex and sometimes contradictory attributes, a series of life experiences, a host of psychological dynamics, and an array of ideological and organizational skills.</p>
<p>The professional revolutionary is an outgrowth of increasing urbanization, rapid developments in communication and transportation, the trend toward universal education, and diffusion of revolutionary ideologies. In a word, ironical as it may be, the professional revolutionary is an inescapable by-product of the very modernity that has been a distinguishing mark of the twentieth century.</p>

    <h2><a href="http://bradspangler.com/blog/archives/1562" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Another note on the term &#8220;private property&#8221;">Another note on the term &#8220;private property&#8221;</a></h2>

    <div class="entry">
    <p>The term &#8220;private property&#8221; can serve an obfuscatory role, unfortunately. While Rothbard considered his radically anti-state version of Lockean property theory best, he also explicitly pointed to the usufruct ownership standard as superior to existing property relations under statism, which minarchists typically defend reflexively, in his essay &#8220;<a href="http://mises.org/journals/jls/20_1/20_1_2.pdf">The Spooner-Tucker Doctrine: An Economist&#8217;s View</a>&#8220;.</p>
<blockquote><p>My second political difference with Spooner-Tucker is on the land question, specifically on the question of property rights in land title. Here, however, I believe that the Tucker position is superior to that of current laissez-faire economists who either take no position on land or else blithely assume that all land titles must be protected simply because some government has declared them “private property”; and superior to the Henry Georgists, who recognize the existence of a land problem but who deny the justice of any private property in ground land. The thesis of the individualist anarchists, developed by Joshua K. Ingalls, was that private ownership of land should be recognized only in those who themselves are using the specific areas of land. Such a theory of property would automatically abolish all rent payments for land, since only the direct user of a piece of land would be recognized as its owner.</p>
<p>While I strongly disagree with this doctrine, it does supply a useful corrective to those libertarians and laissez-faire economists who refuse to consider the problem of land monopoly in the State’s arbitrary granting of land titles to its favorites, and therefore who fail completely to tackle what is probably the number one problem in the undeveloped countries today. It is not enough to call simply for defense of the “rights of private property”; there must be an adequate theory of justice in property rights, else any property that some State once decreed to be “private” must now be defended by Libertarians, no matter how unjust the procedure or how mischievous its consequences.</p>
<p>In my view, the proper theory of justice in landed property can be found in John Locke: that it first become private property by the use criterion. This rules out State sales of unused and unowned “public domain” to land speculators in advance of use, as conveying any valid title whatever. This much of the way I proceed with Ingalls and the anarchists. But once use and settlement convey proper title, it seems to me a complete violation of the Spooner-Tucker “law of<br />
equal liberty” to prevent that legitimate owner from selling his land to someone else.</p></blockquote>
<p>If property rights are the heart and soul of libertarianism, and I believe they are, then anarchists espousing usufruct are closer to our correct position than any Constitutionalist might be, despite their hostility to the term &#8220;private property&#8221; or our description of Rothbardian property theory as &#8220;private property&#8221;.</p>

    <h2><a href="http://bradspangler.com/blog/archives/1558" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to The Cold War Is Over And We Lost">The Cold War Is Over And We Lost</a></h2>

    <div class="entry">
    <p>I&#8217;ve previously pointed out, and continue to, that Benjamin Tucker made a persuasive case that free market anarchism is best understood as a variety of socialism in his essay &#8220;<a href="http://praxeology.net/BT-SSA.htm">State Socialism and Anarchism: How Far They Agree and Wherein They Differ</a>&#8220;. I&#8217;ve also made the point that Tucker&#8217;s case is by no means contingent on the labor theory of value being a part of the particular formulation of market anarchist doctrine in question. Nor is it contingent upon his later rejection of natural rights for egoism or his use of Proudhon&#8217;s usufruct ownership standard (as opposed to modern Rothbardian property theory). Completely freeing markets of state granted privilege, subsidy and restraint of competition answers <em>the social question</em>. We&#8217;re socialists.</p>
<p>Additionally, I&#8217;ve pointed out how leading so-called &#8220;anarcho-capitalist&#8221; thinkers such as Hans Herman Hoppe acknowledge that <a href="http://mises.org/daily/3677">the Marxist critique of the status quo is &#8220;essentially correct&#8221;</a>. I&#8217;ve also explained numerous times in informal settings that this hostility of ours to the status quo can and ought to be described as opposing &#8220;capitalism&#8221; &#8212; because capitalism can be understood as state-driven monopolization of capital. Note carefully that it&#8217;s not that we only object to monopolization of capital when it&#8217;s state-driven. Rather, <a href="http://mises.org/rothbard/mes/chap10a.asp">Rothbardian theory indicates</a> that forming and maintaining an exploitative monopoly of any sort <strong>must</strong> be a state-driven process.</p>
<p>Now, some or all of these arguments are often rejected out of hand by my libertarian comrades. Verily, with horror. Or, rather, the various points of argument are seldom specifically rejected, let alone refuted &#8212; but the conclusion that they add up to, that we are socialists dedicated to the overthrow of capitalism, is dismissed on the basis that it&#8217;s incompatible with our existing narrative, rather than our body of theory. We&#8217;re used to thinking of ourselves as &#8220;capitalists&#8221; in the sense of advocacy of a completely free market economy. In this sense &#8220;capitalism&#8221; is held forth as an unrealized ideal fundamentally at odds with the oppressive status quo. The principal problem with this line of thinking is that the Cold War is over and we lost. When I say &#8220;we&#8221;, in this case, I mean &#8220;radical free market libertarians&#8221; rather than the Soviet communists. For an entire lifetime, American civilization was barraged with propaganda from both proponents and opponents of &#8220;capitalism&#8221; that the American status quo was &#8220;capitalism&#8221;. When attempting to explain a stateless free market as &#8220;capitalism&#8221;, besides everything else you need to persuade and convince people of you <strong>also</strong> face the additional burden of trying to convince people to reject the incredibly deeply ingrained notion that the status quo is &#8220;capitalism&#8221;. We lost the Cold War. Asserting that the US is not &#8220;capitalist&#8221; will be regarded as an absurdity.</p>
<p>Libertarian acceptance of the &#8220;we&#8217;re capitalists and statism is socialism&#8221; narrative can be seen as a tribalistic or ceremonial sharing of stories with those we have hoped to influence. A shared mythology makes a tribe. Libertarian theory advocates free markets and it&#8217;s irrefutable. On the other hand, libertarian mythology attempts to describe a particular vision of American history as a falling from &#8220;capitalist&#8221; grace into the burning, sulfurous pit of &#8220;socialism&#8221;. As a consequence, the more radical critiques of the status quo and history that libertarian theory enables tend to be de-emphasized in the interests of not merely making reformist political alliances, but implicitly appealing to a shared historical narrative to emphasize aspects of libertarianism that (it is hoped) will be found more convincing by those with a right wing mindset. The problem with that approach is that if we, as a movement, are to reject reformism as a strategy and turn toward revolution, we must recognize that the conservative temperament is ill-suited to joining a revolutionary cadre.</p>
