                        future White House press conference. "Mr Bush, you have 
                        just successfully invaded Iraq. What are you going to do 
                        now?"<BR><BR>"Why, I�m going to Disney World." 
                        <BR><BR>If only it were that easy. In truth the United 
                        States faces grave difficulties, even after a successful 
                        invasion. It must have a successor regime ready to take 
                        over in Baghdad from Saddam Hussein. But assembling such 
                        a regime is no easy task, given the squabbling factions 
                        that make up the disparate Iraqi opposition. 
                        <BR><BR>Indeed, they mirror the Iraqi population itself, 
                        which is split between Sunnis, Shi'ites and Kurds - all 
                        of which are further subdivided into competing clans and 
                        tribes. Turkey would not like a separatist Kurdish state 
                        on its borders, while the US cannot afford to prop up 
                        the Shi'ites as they could easily join Iran at a later 
                        stage. <BR><BR>It is strange enough that the United 
                        States may soon be going to war against Iraq mainly 
                        because it does not like its head of state. But it is 
                        even more mystifying that there has been even less 
                        discussion of what happens if the United States achieves 
                        its goal. For the issue of what happens in and to Iraq 
                        after Saddam will certainly have regional and global 
                        repercussions. Indeed, Iraq could be the classic case of 
                        be careful what you wish for because you just might get 
                        it. <BR><BR>Many outside analysts are starting to ask 
                        what about the day after the invasion? Does the United 
                        States have a workable plan for a post-Saddam Iraq? And, 
                        most important, does the US itself plan on sticking 
                        around long enough to build a new Iraq that is 
                        reasonably stable, peaceful, and democratic? Or will the 
                        Americans bug out after a few months or a year, leaving 
                        the job of putting Iraq back together again to the 
                        United Nations or to Europe or, perhaps even to Iran? 
                        <BR><BR>Considering the distate of the administration of 
                        George W Bush for "nation-building" and "peacekeeping", 
                        these are critical questions. <BR><BR>As Robert Kagan of 
                        the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace wrote in 
                        the Washington Post, �One gets a whiff of it in Bosnia, 
                        from which the Pentagon seemingly can't wait to 
                        extricate itself. And, more disturbingly, one sees it in 
                        Afghanistan, where the administration's aversion to 
                        nation-building and peacekeeping, and even to putting 
                        substantial numbers of troops on the ground to fight the 
                        war, is palpable. The Bush administration may have its 
                        reasons for limiting the US commitment to Afghanistan, 
                        but the effect so far has been to cast doubt on American 
                        willingness to stay anywhere for the long haul, 
                        including in a post-Hussein Iraq." <BR><BR>In 1999, 
                        Dilip Hiro, a veteran Middle Eastern observer, wrote, 
                        "How will such a new ruler cope with inevitable 
                        bloodletting as thousands of Iraqis who have suffered 
                        under Saddam's rule, kill intelligence agents and Baath 
                        party officials? How will Iran, with a network of agents 
                        and sympathizers among Iraqi Shi'ites, respond to a 
                        pro-US general in Baghdad? How will Syria�s President 
                        Assad, surrounded by hostile Israel, unfriendly Turkey 
                        and an untested young King of Jordan, react to the 
                        emergence of a pro-US regime to the east? No prizes for 
                        the answers, which, point toward a civil war in 
                        post-Saddam Iraq, which will inevitably draw in Jordan, 
                        Syria, Turkey, Iran, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, and 
                        destabilize the whole region." <BR><BR>At a London 
                        conference of former Iraqi military officers in July, 
                        the question of what would happen after Saddam went was 
                        the main topic of conversation. "Given Iraq�s 40-year 
                        history of repression, it is highly likely that blood 
                        will fill the streets," said Major-General Saad Obeidi, 
                        in charge of psychological warfare before defecting in 
                        1986. <BR><BR>Writing in the spring issue of Washington 
                        Quarterly, Michael Isherwood, a lieutenant-colonel in 
                        the US Air Force, wrote, "US policymakers must think 
                        beyond merely removing Saddam and recognize that peace 
                        will come to the region only with an Iraqi government 
                        that respects the international rule of law and the 
                        rights of all its citizens." <BR><BR>But thus far almost 
                        no thought appears to have been given as to how this 
                        will be achieved. <BR><BR>Surprisingly, it turns out 
                        that having Saddam Hussein in power is not the worst of 
                        all possible words. Last year, Daniel Byman, director of 
                        the Rand Center for Middle East public policy, wrote, 
                        "Saddam's continuation in power also has some surprising 
                        benefits. First, Saddam�s aggressiveness and outright 
                        evil have created a strong and broad consensus that Iraq 
                        must be contained to some degree. Any successor to 
                        Saddam, even if cast from the same mold, would probably 
                        receive control over Iraq�s purse strings from the 
                        United Nations, a warm welcome in most regional 
                        capitals, and the benefit of the doubt most generally. 
                        Second, Saddam�s incompetence as a general is matched 
                        only by his ineptitude as a diplomat. Any likely 
                        successor, even including those who share his aggressive 
                        ambitions, would likely be more skilled. The United 
                        States and its allies should continue to seek Saddam�s 
                        removal, but should prepare for trouble down the road; 
                        especially in the event that they succeed incompletely 
                        and a leader from the same power base emerges." 
                        <BR><BR>It is also unclear that a new Iraqi regime would 
                        want to give up its nuclear, biological and chemical 
                        programs, that is, weapons of mass destruction (WMD). 
                        Iraq lives in a rough neighborhood. Iran, Pakistan, 
                        Syria, Turkey and Israel all possess various types of 
                        WMD and missiles. A future Iraqi regime seeking WMD as a 
                        deterrent is likely, if not desirable. <BR><BR>Also, 
                        enmity towards Israel is likely to remain. Saddam gained 
                        considerable prestige by repeatedly threatening Israel 
                        and a successor might seek to gain similar support by 
                        maintaining a hostile policy, or at least rhetoric, 
                        towards Israel. <BR><BR>If an invasion succeeds, Western 
                        forces need to be prepared for a long haul. Recently, 
                        British cabinet ministers were told that British troops 
                        would have to be stationed in Iraq for up to five years 
                        as part of an "occupation force" once Saddam Hussein had 
                        been removed from power. It is thought that up to 15,000 
                        troops would have to remain in the region for several 
                        years to help support the post-Saddam government, in 
                        much the way as an international stabilization force now 
                        operates in Afghanistan. <BR><BR>But even a successful 
                        invasion of Iraq could have negative consequences 
                        elsewhere. "The consequences [of an American attack] 
                        will not be confined to Iraq," said Egyptian Foreign 
                        Minister Ahmed Maher. He warned that US action against 
                        Iraq could ignite hostility across a Muslim world 
                        already incensed over Israel's treatment of Palestinians 
                        and consequently threaten the stability of Egypt, 
                        Jordan, Saudi Arabia and other US allies in the Arab 
                        world. <BR><BR>Indeed, a key question that has not been 
                        addressed is what effect a US invasion of Iraq would 
                        have on the broader conflict between Islam and the West? 
                        If al-Qaeda grew out of the humiliations attached to the 
                        Gulf War and the stationing of US troops in Osama bin 
                        Laden's native land, Saudi Arabia, what would grow out 
                        of the new humiliation of a massive long-term occupation 
                        in Iraq by the United States? <BR><BR>(�2002 Asia Times
