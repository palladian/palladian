<h1 id="d0e615">Preface</h1> 
<p id="d0e620">This report is based on two months' field work pursued during May and June, 1903. Accompanied by Mr. J. Diamond, a photographer, 
the writer went in the latter part of April to Iba, Zambales, where a few days were spent in investigating the dialects of 
the Zambal people and in preparation for a trip to the interior. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e623">After a journey of 25 miles inland a camp was established near Tagiltil. During the three weeks we were there the camp was 
visited by about 700 Negritos, who came in from outlying settlements, often far back in the mountains; but, owing to the fact 
that most of them would remain only as long as they were fed, extended investigations had to be conducted largely among the 
residents of Tagiltil and the neighboring rancheria of Villar. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e626">From Tagiltil a trip was made southward behind the low mountain chain, which marks the limit of the plain, and through a hitherto 
unexplored territory, very broken and next to impassable except in the dry season. The trail, known only to Negritos and but 
little used, followed for the most part the beds of mountain streams. Four little rancherias were passed, the people of two 
of which had already visited us. A hard two-day trip brought us to Santa F&eacute;, a barrio of San Marcelino. After a week with 
the Negritos at this place a trip was made toward the Pampanga boundary to Cabayan and Aglao, the former locality inhabited 
by several small groups of Negritos, the latter an isolated Ilokano barrio in and near which the Negritos live. A visit to 
the rancherias near Subig and Olongapo concluded the investigation. In all, more than a thousand Negritos were seen. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e629">With only a short time at a place it is evident that an exhaustive study of the people of any particular locality could not 
be made. But the culture plane of the entire area is practically the same, and the facts as here presented should give a good 
idea of the customs and the general condition of the Negritos of Zambales Province. The short time at my disposal for the 
investigation is my only excuse for the meager treatment given some lines of study&#8212;as, for example, physical anthropology 
and language. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e632">Inasmuch as nothing has yet been published by The Ethnological Survey on the Negritos of the Philippines, I have thought it 
not out of place to preface my report with an introductory chapter on their <span id="d0e634" class="pageno">page 10</span>distribution. The data contained therein have been compiled by me from information gathered by the Survey during the past 
two years and are sufficiently authentic for the present purpose. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e637">The photographs of the Zambales Negritos were made by Mr. J. Diamond and those of the Bataan Negritos are from the collection 
of Hon. Dean C. Worcester, Secretary of the Interior. Credit for each photograph is given on the plate as it appears.

<h2 id="d0e651" class="abovehead">Chapter 1</h2> 
<h1>Distribution of Negritos</h1> 
<p id="d0e656">Probably no group of primitive men has attracted more attention from the civilized world than the pygmy blacks. From the time 
of Homer and Aristotle the pygmies, although their existence was not absolutely known at that early period, have had their 
place in fable and legend, and as civilized man has become more and more acquainted with the unknown parts of the globe he 
has met again and again with the same strange type of the human species until he has been led to conclude that there is practically 
no part of the tropic. zone where these little blacks have not lived at some time. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e659">Mankind at large is interested in a race of dwarfs just as it would be in a race of giants, no matter what the color or social 
state; and scientists have long been concerned with trying to fix the position of the pygmies in the history of the human 
race. That they have played an important ethnologic r&ocirc;le can not be doubted; and although to-day they are so scattered and 
so modified by surrounding people as largely to have disappeared as a pure type, yet they have everywhere left their imprint 
on the peoples who have absorbed them. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e662">The Negritos of the Philippines constitute one branch of the Eastern division of the pygmy race as opposed to the African 
division, it being generally recognized that the blacks of short stature may be so grouped in two large and comprehensive 
divisions. Other well-known branches of the Eastern group are the Mincopies of the Andaman Islands and perhaps also the Papuans 
of New Guinea, very similar in many particulars to the Negritos of the Philippines, although authorities differ in grouping 
the Papuans with the Negritos. The Asiatic continent is also not without its representatives of the black dwarfs, having the 
Sakai of the Malay Peninsula. The presence of Negritos over so large an area has especially attracted the attention of anthropologists 
who have taken generally one or the other of two theories advanced to explain it: First, that the entire oceanic region is 
a partly submerged continent, once connected with the Asiatic mainland and over which this aboriginal race spread prior to 
the subsidence. The second theory is that the peopling of the several archipelagoes by the Negritos has been a gradual <span id="d0e664" class="pageno">page 14</span>spread from island to island. This latter theory, advanced by De Quatrefages,<a id="d0e666src" href="#d0e666" class="noteref">1</a> is the generally accepted one, although it is somewhat difficult to believe that the ancestors of weak and scattered tribes 
such as to-day are found in the Philippines could ever have been the sea rovers that such a belief would imply. It is a well-known 
fact, however, that the Malays have spread in this manner, and, while it is hardly possible that the Negritos have ever been 
as bold seafarers as the Malays, yet where they have been left in undisputed possession of their shores they have remained 
reckless fishermen. The statement that they are now nearly always found in impenetrable mountain forests is not an argument 
against the migration-by-sea theory, because they have been surrounded by stronger races and have been compelled to flee to 
the forests or suffer extermination. The fact that they live farther inland than the stronger peoples is also evidence that 
they were the first inhabitants, for it is not natural to suppose that a weaker race could enter territory occupied by a stronger 
and gain a permanent foothold there.<a id="d0e669src" href="#d0e669" class="noteref">2</a> 
<span id="d0e733" class="pageno">page 15</span> 
</p> 
<p id="d0e736">The attention of the first Europeans who visited the Philippines was attracted by people with frizzly hair and with a skin 
darker in color than that of the ruling tribes. Pigafetta, to whom we are indebted for <span id="d0e738" class="pageno">page 16</span>an account of Magellan's voyage of discovery in 1521, mentions Negritos as living in the Island of Panglao, southwest of Bohol 
and east of Cebu.<a id="d0e740src" href="#d0e740" class="noteref">3</a> If we are to believe later historians the shores of some of the islands fairly swarmed with Negritos when the Spaniards arrived. 
Meyer gives an interesting extract from an old account by Galvano, The Discoveries of the World (ed. Bethune, Hakluyt Soc., 
1862, p. 234):<a id="d0e743src" href="#d0e743" class="noteref">4</a>

decked, wherein the master and principall men sate on high, and vnderneath were very blacke moores with frizled haire * * 
*: and being demanded where they had these blacke moores, they answered, that they had them from certaine islands standing 
fast by Sebut, where there were many of them.

<div class="blockquote"> 
<p id="d0e763">The Negritos which our first conquerors found were, according to tradition, the first possessors of the islands of this Archipelago, 
and, having been conquered by the political nations of other kingdoms, they fled to the mountains and populated them, whence 
no one has been able to accomplish their extermination on account of the inaccessibility of the places where they live. In 
the past they were so proud of their primitive dominion that, although they did not have strength to resist the strangers 
in the open, in the woods and mountains and mouths of the rivers they were very powerful. They made sudden attacks on the 
pueblos and compelled their neighbors to pay tribute to them as to lords of the earth which they inhabited, and if these did 
not wish to pay them they killed right and left, collecting the tribute in heads. * * * 
</p> 
<p id="d0e766">One of the islands of note in this Archipelago is that called Isla de Negros on account of the abundance of them [negroes]. 
In one point of this island&#8212;on the west side, called &#8220;Sojoton&#8221;&#8212;there is a great number of Negritos, and in the center of the 
island many more.

</p> 
<p id="d0e785">Meyer,<a id="d0e787src" href="#d0e787" class="noteref">8</a> who has given the subject much study and has conducted personal investigations on the field, states that &#8220;although at the 
time of the arrival of the Spaniards in the country, and probably long before, the Negritos were in process of being driven 
back by the Malays, yet it appears certain that their numbers were then larger, for they were feared by their neighbors, which 
is now only exceptionally the case.&#8221; 
</p> 
<p id="d0e791">Of the vast amount of material that has been written during the past century on the Negritos of the Philippines a considerable 
portion can not be taken authoritatively. Exceptions should be made of the writings of Meyer, Montano, Marche, and Blumentritt. 
A large part of the writings on the Philippine Negritos have to do with their distribution and numbers, since no one has made 
an extended study of them on the spot, except Meyer, whose work (consisting of twelve chapters and published in Volume IX 
of the Publications of the Royal Ethnographical Museum of Dresden, 1893) I regret not to have seen. Two chapters of this work 
on the distribution of the Negritos, republished in 1899, form the most recent and most nearly correct exposition of this 
subject. Meyer summarizes as follows: 
<div class="blockquote"> 
<p id="d0e795">It may be regarded as proved with certainty that Negritos are found in Luzon, Alabat, Corregidor, Panay, Tablas, Negros, Cebu, 
northeast Mindanao, and Palawan. It is questionable whether they occur in Guimaras, Mindoro, and the Calamianes. 
</p> 
</div> 
</p> 
<p id="d0e800">This statement would be more nearly correct if Corregidor and Cebu were placed in the second list and Guimaras in the first. 
In this paper it is possible, by reason of special investigations, to give more reliable and detailed information on this 
subject than any yet published. 
</p> 
<h2 id="d0e803">Present Distribution in the Philippines<a id="d0e807src" href="#d0e807" class="noteref">9</a> 
</h2> 
<h3 id="d0e814">In Luzon</h3> 
<p id="d0e819">This paper concerns itself chiefly with the Zambales Negritos whose distribution in Zambales and the contiguous Provinces 
of Bataan, Pampanga, and Tarlac is treated in detail in the following chapter. But Negritos of more or less pure blood, known 
variously as Aeta, Agta, Baluga, Dumagat, etc., are found in at least eleven other provinces of Luzon. Beginning with the 
southern end of the island there are a very few Negritos in the Province of Sorsogon. They are found generally living among 
the Bicol population and do not run wild in the woods; they have probably drifted down from the neighboring Province of <span id="d0e821" class="pageno">page 18</span>Albay. According to a report submitted by the governor of Sorsogon there are a few of these Negritos in Bacon and Bulusan, 
and four families containing Negrito blood are on the Island of Batang near Gabat.

<p class="figureHead">Outline map of the Philippine Islands, showing distribution of Negritos.</p> 
</div> 
</p> 
<p id="d0e830">Eight pueblos of Albay report altogether as many as 800 Negritos, known locally as &#8220;Agta.&#8221; It is not likely any of them are 
of pure blood. In all except three of the towns they are servants in Bicol houses, but Malinao, Bacacay, and Tabaco report 
wandering groups in the mountains. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e833">Meyer, who makes no mention of Negritos in Sorsogon or Albay, deems their existence in the Camarines sufficiently well authenticated, 
according to Blumentritt, who places Negrito half-breeds in the neighborhood of Lagonoy and around Mount Isarog. Information 
received by The Ethnological Survey places them in the mountains near Baao, Bulic, Iriga, Lagonoy, San Jos&eacute;, Gao, and Tigaon, 
as well as scattered over the Cordillera de Isarog around Sagnay. All of these places are in the extreme southeastern part 
of the province contiguous to that part of Albay inhabited by Negritos. In neither province is the type pure. In the northern 
part of the province a few Negritos, called &#8220;Dumagat,&#8221; are reported near Sipocot and Ragay. The towns of San Vicente, Labo, 
Paracale, Mambulao, and Capalonga along the north coast also have Negritos, generally called &#8220;Aeta.&#8221; These are probably of 
purer blood than those around Mount Isarog. More than a hundred families of &#8220;Dumagat&#8221; are reported on the Islands of Caringo, 
Caluat, and Jomalic. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e836">Farther to the north the Island of Alabat was first stated by Blumentritt to be inhabited by Dumagat, and in his map of 1882 
he places them here but omits them in the map of 1890. Meyer deems their occurrence there to be beyond all doubt, as per Steen 
Bille's reports (Reise der Galathea, German ed., 1852). Reports of The Ethnological Survey place Aeta, Baluga, and Dumagat 
on Alabat&#8212;the former running wild in the mountains, the latter living in the barrios of Camagon and Silangan, respectively. On the mainland of the Province 
of Tayabas the Negritos are generally known as Aeta and may be regarded as being to a large degree of pure blood. They are 
scattered pretty well over the northern part of the province, but do not, so far as is known, extend down into the peninsula 
below Pitogo and Macalelon. Only at Mauban are they known as Baluga, which name seems to indicate a mixed breed. The Island 
of Polillo and the districts of Infanta and Principe, now part of the Province of Tayabas, have large numbers of Negritos 
probably more nearly approaching a pure physical type than those south of them. The Negritos of Binangonan and Baler have 
received attention in short papers from Blumentritt, but it yet remains for someone to make a study of them on the spot. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e842">Meyer noted in 1872 that Negritos frequently came from the mountains <span id="d0e844" class="pageno">page 19</span>to Santa Cruz, Laguna Province. These probably came from across the Tayabas line, as none are reported in Laguna except from 
Santa Maria, in the extreme northern part. Even these are probably very near the boundary line into Rizal Province; perhaps 
they are over the line. Tanay, Rizal Province, on the shore of Laguna de Bay, reports some 300 Negritos as living in the mountains 
north of that town. From descriptions given by natives of Tanay they do not appear to be pure types. There is also a small 
group near Montalb&aacute;n, in Rizal Province, not more than 20 miles from Manila. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e847">Going northward into Bulacan we are in possession of more definite information regarding the whereabouts of these forest dwellers. 
Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga in 1803 spoke of the Negritos of Angat&#8212;in those days head-hunters who were accustomed to send messages by means of knotted 
grass stalks.<a id="d0e852src" href="#d0e852" class="noteref">10</a> 
</p> 
<p id="d0e856">This region, the upper reaches of the Angat River, was visited by Mr. E. J. Simons on a collecting trip for The Ethnological 
Survey in February, 1903. Mr. Simons saw twenty-two little rancherias of the Dumagat, having a total population of 176 people. 
Some of them had striking Negroid characteristics, but nearly all bore evidence of a mixture of blood. In some cases full- 
blooded Filipinos have married into the tribe and adopted Negrito customs entirely. Their social state is about the same as 
that of the Negritos of Zambales, though some of their habits&#8212;for instance, betel chewing&#8212;approach more nearly those of lower-class 
Filipinos. A short vocabulary of their dialect is given in Appendix B. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e859">Negritos are also found in northern Bulacan and throughout the continuous mountain region extending through Nueva Ecija into 
Isabela and the old Province of Principe. They are reported from Pe&ntilde;aranda, Bongabong, and Pantabangan, in Nueva Ecija, to 
the number of 500. This region is yet to be fully explored; the same may be said also of that vast range of mountains, the 
Sierra Madre, of Isabela and Cagayan. In the Province of Isabela Negritos are reported from all the towns, especially Palanan, 
on the coast, and Carig, Echague, Angadanan, Cauayan, and Cabagan Nuevo, on the upper reaches of the Rio Grande de Cagayan, 
but as there is a vast unknown country between, future exploration will have to determine the numerical importance of the 
Negritos. It has been thought heretofore that this region contained a large number of people of pure blood. This was the opinion 
set forth by Blumentritt. He says: 
<div class="blockquote"> 
<p id="d0e863">This coast is the only spot in the Philippines in which the original masters of the Archipelago, the Negritos, hold unrestricted 
possession of their native land. The eastern side of the Cordillera which slopes toward this coast is also their undisputed 
possession. However, the western slopes they have been compelled to share with branches of Malay descendants. Here they retain 
the greatest purity of original physique and character. 
</p> 
</div> 
<span id="d0e867" class="pageno">page 20</span> 
</p> 
<p id="d0e870">These statements stand much in need of verification. Inquiries pursued by The Ethnological Survey do not bear them out&#8212;in 
fact, point to an opposite belief. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e873">There is a small body of what may be pure types near the boundary between Isabela and Cagayan, west of the Cagayan River, 
but the coast region, so far as is known, does not hold any Negritos. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e876">As many as sixteen towns of Cagayan report Negritos to the total number of about 2,500. They are known commonly as &#8220;Atta,&#8221; 
but in the pueblo of Baggao there are three groups known locally as &#8220;Atta,&#8221; &#8220;Diango,&#8221; and &#8220;Paranan.&#8221; They have been described 
by natives of Baggao as being very similar to the ordinary Filipinos in physical characteristics except that they are darker 
in color and have bushy hair. Their only weapons are the bow and arrow. Their social status is in every way like that of the 
Negritos as distinguished from the industrious mountain. Malayans of northern Luzon. Yet future investigations may not associate 
these robust and warlike tribes with the weak, shirking Negritos. Negritos of pure type have not so far been reported from 
Cagayan. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e879">At only two places in the western half of northern Luzon have Negritos been observed. There is a small group near Piddig, 
Ilokos Norte, and a wandering band of about thirty-five in the mountains between Villavieja, Abra Province, and Santa Maria, 
Ilokos Sur Province, from both of which towns they have been reported. It is but a question of time until no trace of them 
will be left in this region so thickly populated with stronger mountain peoples. 
</p> 
<h3 id="d0e883">In the Southern Islands</h3> 
<p id="d0e888">Although Negritos were reported by the early Spanish writers to be especially numerous in some of the southern islands, probably 
more of them are found on Luzon than on all the other islands in the Archipelago. Besides Luzon, the only large islands inhabited 
by them at present are Panay, Negros, Mindanao, and Paragua, but some of the smaller islands, as Tablas and Guimaras, have 
them. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e891">Negritos of pure blood have not been reported from Mindoro, but only the half-breed Manguian, who belong in a group to themselves. 
It is questionable whether the unknown interior will produce pure types, though it is frequently reported that there are Negritos 
in the interior. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e894">There is a rather large colony of Negritos on the west coast of Tablas near Odiungan, and also a few on the Isla de Carabao 
immediately south of Tablas. These have probably passed up from Panay. All the provinces of the latter island report Negritos, 
locally known as &#8220;Ati&#8221; and &#8220;Agta.&#8221; They seem to be scattered pretty well over the interior of Panay, being especially numerous 
in the mountainous region where the Provinces of Antique and Iloilo join. In Antique there <span id="d0e896" class="pageno">page 21</span>are about 1,000 Negritos living in groups of several families each. They are reported from nearly all the towns, being more 
numerous along the Dalanas and Sibalon Rivers. The number of pure types is said, however, to be rapidly decreasing on account 
of intermarriage with the Bukidnon or mountain Visayan. They are of very small stature, with kinky hair. They lead the same 
nomadic life as the Negritos in other parts, except that they depend more on the products of the forest for subsistence and 
rarely clear and cultivate &#8220;ca-&#301;ng-&#301;n.&#8221;<a id="d0e898src" href="#d0e898" class="noteref">11</a> They seem to have developed more of religious superstitions, and believe that both evil spirits and protecting spirits inhabit 
the forests and plains. However, these beliefs may have been borrowed from the Bukidnon, with whom they come much in contact. 
From a mixing of the Ati and Bukidnon are sprung the Calibugan, who partake more of the characteristics of their Visayan ancestors 
than those of the Ati, and generally abandon the nomadic life and live in clearings in the forest. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e902">About ten years ago there was a group of about 200 Ati at a place called Labangan, on the Dalanas River, governed by one Capit&aacute;n 
Andres. They made clearings and carried people across the river for a small remuneration. Many of them are said to have emigrated 
to Negros to escape public work to which the local authorities subjected them without compensation. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e905">There is a small, wandering group of Negritos on Guimaras, probably emigrants from Panay. They have been reported from both 
Nagaba and Nueva Valencia, pueblos of that island. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e908">Investigation does not bear out the statements of the historian previously quoted in regard to the early populations of Negros. 
At least it seems that if the southwestern part of that island known as Sojoton had been so thickly populated with Negritos 
early in the eighteenth century more traces of them would remain to-day. But they seem to have left no marks on the Malayan 
population. While in the Isio region in August, 1903, I made special investigation and inquiry into this subject and could 
find no trace of Negritos. Expeditions of the Constabulary into the interior have never met with the little blacks except 
a single colony near the boundary line between the two provinces just north of Tolon. A few Negritos have also been seen scattered 
in the interior of southern Oriental Negros back from Nueva Valencia, Ayuquitan, and Bais. From there no trace of them exists 
until the rugged mountains north of the volcano of Canlaon are reached, in the almost impenetrable recesses of which there 
are estimated to be a thousand or more. They are especially numerous back of Escalante and formerly made frequent visits to 
that pueblo, but recent military operations in the region have made them timid, as scouting parties have fired on and killed 
several of them. The sight of a white man or native of the <span id="d0e910" class="pageno">page 22</span>plain is a signal for an immediate discharge of arrows. Also in the mountains behind Sagay, Cadiz, and Manapla live a few 
scattered families. I was fortunate in securing photographs of a Negrito captured by the Constabulary near Cadiz. (See <a href="#d0e8149">Pl. XXVI.</a>) He was much taller than the Negritos of Zambales, but with very little muscular development. He spoke Visayan, and said 
he knew no other dialect. While in Negros I also secured photographs of a small colony of Ati, who emigrated from Panay about 
twenty years ago and now live on a mountain hacienda on the slope of Mount Canlaon. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e916">So far there is no evidence that Negritos exist on Cebu, Bohol, Samar, and Leyte. In Mindanao they are found only in the extreme 
northern part of Surigao, not having been reported below Tago. They are called &#8220;Mamanua,&#8221; and are not very numerous. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e919">We have detailed accounts of both the Tagbanua and Batak of Paragua, by se&ntilde;or Manuel Venturello, a native of Puerto Princesa, 
who has lived among them twenty years. These interesting articles, translated by Capt. E. A. Helmick, Tenth United States 
Infantry, and published in pamphlet form by the Division of Military Information, Manila, are especially full as to customs, 
religion, language, etc., of the Tagbanua who inhabit the central part of Paragua from the Bay of Ulugan south to Apurahuan. 
However, the Tagbanua, although perhaps having a slight amount of Negrito blood, can not be classed with the Negritos. But, 
in my opinion, the Batak who inhabit the territory from the Bay of Ulugan north to Caruray and Barbacan may be so classed, 
although they are by no means of pure blood. They are described as being generally of small stature but well developed and 
muscular. They have very curly but not kinky hair, except in rare cases. Their weapons are the bow and arrow and the blowgun 
or sumpitan, here called &#8220;sumpit.&#8221; Their only clothing is a breechcloth and a short skirt of flayed bark. A notable feature 
of their customs is that both polygyny and polyandry are permitted, this being the only instance of the latter practice so 
far observed among the tribes of the Philippines. The Batak are not very numerous; their villages have been decimated by ravages 
of smallpox during the past five years. 
</p> 
<h2 id="d0e924">Conclusion</h2> 
<p id="d0e929">This rapid survey leaves much to be desired, but it contains about all that is definitely known to-day concerning the whereabouts 
of the Negritos in the Philippines. No attempt has been made to state numbers. The Philippine census will probably have more 
exact information in this particular, but it must be borne in mind that even the figures given by the census can be no more 
than estimates in most instances. The habits of the Negritos do not lend themselves to modern methods of census taking. 
<span id="d0e931" class="pageno">page 23</span> 
</p> 
<p id="d0e934">After all, Blumentritt's opinion of several years ago is not far from right. Including all. mixed breeds having a preponderance 
of Negrito blood, it is safe to say that the Negrito population of the Philippines probably will not exceed 25,000. Of these 
the group largest in numbers and probably purest in type is that in the Zambales mountain range, western Luzon. However, while 
individuals may retain in some cases purity of blood, nowhere are whole groups free from mixture with the Malayan. The Negritos 
of Panay, Negros, and Mindanao are also to be regarded as pure to a large extent. On the east side of Luzon and in the Island 
of Paragua, as we have just seen, there is marked evidence of mixture. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e937">The social state of the Negritos is everywhere practically the same. They maintain their half-starved lives by the fruits 
of the chase and forest products, and at best cultivate only small patches of maize and other vegetables. Only occasionally 
do they live in settled, self-supporting communities, but wander for the most part in scattered families from one place to 
another.

</div> 
<div class="notetext"> 
<p mode="notetext"><a id="d0e669" href="#d0e669src" class="noteref">2</a> However, when one attempts to fathom the mysteries surrounding the origin and migrations of the Negrito race he becomes hopelessly 
involved in a labyrinth of conjecture. Did the Negritos come from somewhere in Asia, some island like New Guinea, or is their 
original home now sunk beneath the sea? In the present state of our knowledge we can not hope to know. We find them in certain 
places to-day; we may believe that they once lived in certain other places, because the people now living there have characteristics 
peculiar to the little black men. But the Negrito has left behind no archaeological remains to guide the investigator, and 
he who attempts seriously to consider this question is laying up for himself a store of perplexing problems. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e674" mode="notetext">It may be of interest to present here the leading facts in connection with the distribution of the Negrito race and to summarize 
the views set forth by various leading anthropologists who have given the subject most study. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e677" mode="notetext">The deduction of the French scientists De Quatrefages and Hamy have been based almost entirely on craniological and osteological 
observations, and these authors argue a much wider distribution of the Negritos than other writers hold. In fact, according 
to these writers, traces of Negritos are found practically everywhere from India to Japan and New Guinea. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e680" mode="notetext">De Quatrefages in Les Pygm&eacute;es, 1887, divides what he calls the &#8220;Eastern pygmies,&#8221; as opposed to the African pygmies, into 
two divisions&#8212;the Negrito-Papuans and the Negritos proper. The former, he says, have New Guinea as a center of population 
and extend as far as Gilolo and the Moluccas. They are distinguished from the true Papuans who inhabit New Guinea and who 
are not classed by that writer as belonging to the Negrito race. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e683" mode="notetext">On the other hand, Wallace and Earl, supported by Meyer, all of whom have made some investigations in the region occupied 
by the Papuans, affirm that there is but a single race and that its identity with the Negritos is unmistakable. Meyer (Distribution 
of Negritos, 1898, p. 77) says that he and Von Maclay in 1873 saw a number of Papuans in Tidore. He had just come from the 
Philippines and Von Maclay had then come from Astrolabe Bay, in New Guinea. With these Papuans before them they discussed 
the question of the unity of the races, and Von Maclay could see no difference between these Papuans and those of Astrolabe 
Bay, while Meyer declared that the similarities between them and the Negritos of the Philippines was most striking. He says: 
&#8220;That was my standpoint then regarding the question, neither can I relinquish it at present.&#8221; 
</p> 
<p id="d0e686" mode="notetext">Although they defended the unity of the Negritos and the Papuans they recognized that the Papuans were diversified and presented 
a variety of types, but Meyer regards this not as pointing to a crossing of different elements but as revealing simply the 
variability of the race. He continues (p. 80): &#8220;As the external <i>habitus</i> of the Negritos must be declared as almost identical with that of the Papuans, differences in form of the skull, the size 
of the body, and such like have the less weight in opposition to the great uniformity, as strong contrasts do not even come 
into play here, and if the Negritos do not show such great amount of variation in their physical characters as the Papuans&#8212;which, 
however, <span id="d0e691" class="pageno">page 15</span>is by no means sufficiently attested&#8212;it is no wonder in the case Of a people which has been driven back and deprived of the 
opportunity of developing itself freely.&#8221; 
</p> 
<p id="d0e694" mode="notetext">Thus it remains for future investigations to establish beyond doubt the identity of the Papuans. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e697" mode="notetext">De Quatrefages divides all other Eastern pygmies into two divisions&#8212;insular and continental&#8212;and no authors find fault with 
this classification. Only in fixing the distribution of the Negritos do the authorities differ. The islands admitted by everybody 
to contain Negritos to-day may be eliminated from the discussion. These are the Philippines and the Andamans. In the latter 
the name &#8220;Mincopies&#8221; has been given to the little blacks, though how this name originated no one seems to know. It is certain 
that the people do not apply the name to themselves. Extensive study of the Andamans has been made by Flower and Man. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e700" mode="notetext">The Moluccas and lesser Sunda Islands just west of New Guinea were stated by De Quatrefages in 1887 (Les Pygm&eacute;es) to be inhabited 
by Negritos, although three years previously, as recorded in Hommes Fossiles, 1884, he had doubted their existence there. 
He gave no authority, and assigned no reason in his later work for this change of opinion. Meyer thinks this sufficient reason 
why one should not take De Quatrefages too seriously, and states that proofs of the existence of the Negritos in this locality 
are &#8220;so weak as not to be worth discussing them in detail.&#8221; From deductions based on the examination of a single skull Hamy 
inferred that pure Negritos were found on Timor, but the people of Timor were found by Meyer to be mixed Papuans and Malays, 
resembling the latter on the coasts and the former in the interior. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e703" mode="notetext">Likewise in Celebes, Borneo, and Java the French writers think that traces of an ancient Negrito population may be found, 
while Meyer holds that there is not sufficient evidence to warrant such an assumption. In Sumatra he admits that there is 
an element not Malayan, which on account of the nearness of Malacca may be <i>Negritic,</i> but that fact is so far by no means proved. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e709" mode="notetext">In regard to Formosa Meyer quotes Scheteleg (Trans. Ethn. Sec., n. s., 1869, vii) 
</p> 
<p id="d0e712" mode="notetext">&#8220;I am convinced * * * that the Malay origin of most of the inhabitants of Formosa is incontestable.&#8221; But Hamy holds that the 
two skulls which Scheteleg brought were Negrito skulls, an assumption which Meyer (Distribution of Negritos, 1898, p. 52) 
disposes of as follows: &#8220;To conclude the occurrence of a race in a country from certain characters in two skulls, when this 
race has not been registered from that country, is, in the present embryonic state of craniology, an unwarrantable proceeding.&#8221; 
</p> 
<p id="d0e715" mode="notetext">In like manner Hamy has found that a certain Japanese skull in the Paris Museum resembles a Negrito skull, and he also finds 
traces of Negritos in Japan in the small stature, crisp hair, and darker color of the natives of the interior of the Island 
of Kiusiu. But Meyer holds that the facts brought forward up to the present time are far from being established, and objects 
to the acceptance of surmises and explanations more or less subjective as conclusive. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e718" mode="notetext">There is no doubt of the occurrence of Negritos in the peninsula of Malacca, where both pure and mixed people have been found. 
These are reported under a variety of names, of which Semang and Saka&iacute; are perhaps the best known. Meyer (Distribution of 
Negritos, p. 62, footnote 2) says: &#8220;Stevens divides the Negritos of Malacca into two principal tribes&#8212;the Belendas, who with 
the Tumiors branched off from the Kenis tribe, and the Meniks, who consist of the Panggans of Kelantan and Petani and the 
Semangs of the west coast. Only the Panggans * * * and the Tumiors are pure Negritos. A name often recurring for the Belendas 
is Sakeis (Malay: &#8216;bondman,&#8217; &#8216;servant&#8217;), a designation given them in the first instance by the Malays but which they often 
also apply to themselves when addressing strangers.&#8221; 
</p> 
<p id="d0e721" mode="notetext">In their efforts to find Negrito traces in the Mao-tse, the aboriginal peoples of the Chinese Empire, De Lacouperie and De 
Quatrefages have, in the opinion of Meyer, even less to stand on than had Hamy in the case of Japan. In like manner it remains 
to be proved whether the Moi&iacute; of Annam are related to Negritos, as the two French writers have stated, but whose opinions 
have been vigorously opposed by Meyer and others. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e724" mode="notetext">The question of the aboriginal inhabitants of India is one of even greater importance and presents greater difficulties. If 
it can be shown that this aboriginal population was Negrito, and if the relations which researches, especially in philology, 
have indicated between the peoples of India and those of Australia can be proved, a range of possibilities of startling importance, 
affecting the race question of Oceania in general and the origin and distribution of the Negritos in particular, will be opened 
up. In regard to the Indian question there is much diversity of opinion. De Quatrefages and Hamy, as usual, regard <span id="d0e726" class="pageno">page 16</span>the Negritos as established in India, but Topinard and Virchow are opposed to this belief. Meyer holds that &#8220;this part of 
the Negrito question is in no way ripe for decision, and how much less the question as to a possible relationship of this 
hypothetical primitive population with the Negroes of Africa.&#8221; (Distribution of Negritos, 1899, p. 70.) 
</p> 
<p id="d0e729" mode="notetext">In anthropology a statement may be regarded as proved for the time being so long as no opposition to it exists. With the exception 
of the Philippine and the Andaman Islands and the Malay Peninsula, as we have seen, the presence of traces of Negritos is 
an open question. The evidence at hand is incomplete and insufficient, and we must therefore be content to let future investigators 
work out these unsolved problems.

<h2 id="d0e944" class="abovehead">Chapter 2</h2> 
<h1>The Province of Zambales</h1> 
<h2 id="d0e949">Geographical Features</h2> 
<p id="d0e954">This little-known and comparatively unimportant province stretches along the western coast of Luzon for more than 120 miles. 
Its average width does not exceed 25 miles and is so out of proportion to its length that it merits the title which it bears 
of the &#8220;shoestring province.&#8221;<a id="d0e956src" href="#d0e956" class="noteref">1</a> 
</p> 
<p id="d0e960">The Zambales range of mountains, of which the southern half is known as the Cordillera de Cabusilan and which is second in 
importance to the Caraballos system of northern Luzon, forms the entire eastern boundary of Zambales and separates it from 
the Provinces of Pangasinan, Tarlac, and Pampanga. A number of peaks rise along this chain, of which Mount Pinatubo, 6,040 
feet in height, is the highest. All of the rivers of Zambales rise oil the western slope of these mountains and carry turbulent 
floods through the narrow plains. Still unbridged, they are an important factor in preventing communication and traffic between 
towns, and hence in retarding the development of the province. Another important factor in this connection is the lack of 
safe anchorages. The Zambales coast is a stormy one, and vessels frequently come to grief on its reefs. At only one point, 
Subig Bay, can larger vessels find anchorage safe from the typhoons which sweep the coast. The soil of the well-watered plain 
is fertile and seems adapted to the cultivation of nearly all the products of the Archipelago. The forests are especially 
valuable, and besides fine timbers for constructional purposes they supply large quantities of pitch, resin, bejuco, and beeswax. 
There are no industries worth mentioning, there being only primitive agriculture and stock raising. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e963">The following opinions of Zambales set forth by a Spanish writer in 1880 still hold good:<a id="d0e965src" href="#d0e965" class="noteref">2</a> 
<div class="blockquote"> 
<p id="d0e970">There are more populous and more civilized provinces whose commercial and agricultural progress has been more pronounced, 
but nowhere is the air more pure <span id="d0e972" class="pageno">page 25</span>and transparent, the vegetation more luxuriant, the climate more agreeable, the coasts more sunny, and the inhabitants more 
simple and pacific. 
</p> 
</div> 
</p> 
<h2 id="d0e978">Historical Sketch</h2> 
<p id="d0e983">According to Buzeta, another Spanish historian, it was Juan de Salcedo who discovered Zambales.<a id="d0e985src" href="#d0e985" class="noteref">3</a> 
<div class="blockquote"> 
<p id="d0e990">This intrepid soldier [he says], after having conquered Manila and the surrounding provinces, resolved to explore the northern 
part of Luzon. He organized at his own expense an expedition, and General Legaspi gave him forty-five soldiers, with whom 
he left Manila May 20, 1572. After a journey of three days he arrived at Bolinao, where he found a Chinese vessel whose crew 
had made captives of a chief and several other natives. Salcedo, retook these captives from the Chinese and gave them their 
liberty. The Indians, who were not accustomed to such generosity, were so touched by this act that they became voluntary vassals 
of the Spaniards. 
</p> 
</div> 
</p> 
<p id="d0e995">It seems that nothing further was done toward settling or evangelizing the region for twelve years, although the chronicler 
goes on to say that three years after the discovery of Bolinao a sergeant of Salcedo's traversed the Bolinao region, receiving 
everywhere the homage of the natives, and a Franciscan missionary, Sebastian Baeza, preached the gospel there. But in 1584 
the Augustinians established themselves at the extreme ends of the mountain range, Bolinao and Mariveles. One of them, the 
friar Esteban Martin, was the first to learn the Zambal dialect. The Augustinians were succeeded by the Recollets, who, during 
the period from 1607 to 1680, founded missions at Agno, Balincaguin, Bolinao, Cabangan, Iba, Masinloc, and Santa Cruz. Then 
in 1680, more than a hundred years after Salcedo landed at Bolinao, the Dominicans undertook the active evangelization of 
the district. 
<div class="blockquote"> 
<p id="d0e999">Let us now examine [continues the historian<a id="d0e1001src" href="#d0e1001" class="noteref">4</a>] the, state of these savage Indians whom the zealous Spanish missionaries sought to convert. Father Salazar, after having 
described the topography of this mountainous province, sought to give an idea of the political and social state of the pagans 
who formed the larger part of the aboriginal population: &#8220;The principal cause,&#8221; he said, &#8220;of the barbarity of these Indians, 
and that which prevents their ever being entirely and pacifically converted, is that the distances are so great and communication 
so difficult that the alcaldes can not control them and the missionaries find it impossible to exercise any influence over 
them.&#8221; 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1005">Each village was composed of ten, twenty, or thirty families, united nearly always by ties of kinship. It was difficult to 
bring these villages together because they carried on wars continually, and they lived in such a state of discord that it 
was impossible to govern them; moreover they were so barbarous and fierce that they recognized only superior power. They governed 
through fear. He who wished to be most respected sought to inspire fear by striking off as many beads as possible. The one 
who committed the most assassinations was thus assured of the subordination of all. They made such a glory of it that they 
were accustomed to wear certain ornaments in order to show to the eyes <span id="d0e1007" class="pageno">page 26</span>or all the murders they had committed. When a person lost a relative either by a violent or a natural death he covered his 
head with a strip of black cloth as a sign of mourning and could take it off only after having committed a murder, a thing 
which they were always eager to do in order to get rid of the sadness of mourning, because so long as they wore the badge 
they could not sing or dance or take part in any festivity. One understands then that deaths became very frequent in a country 
where all deaths were necessarily followed by one or more murders. It is true that he who committed a murder sought to atone 
for it by paying to the relatives of the deceased a certain quantity of gold or silver or by giving them a slave or a Negrito 
who might be murdered in his place. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1010">The Zambal had nevertheless more religion than the inhabitants of other provinces. There was among them a high priest, called 
&#8220;Bayoc,&#8221; who by certain rites consecrated the other priests. He celebrated this ceremony in the midst of orgies and the most 
frightful revels. He next indicated to the new priest the idol or cult to which he should specially devote himself and conferred 
on him privileges proportionate to the rank of that divinity, for they recognized among their gods a hierarchy, which established 
also that of their curates. They gave to their principal idol the name of &#8220;Malyari&#8221;&#8212;that is, the powerful. The Bayoc alone 
could offer sacrifice to him. There was another idol, Acasi, whose power almost equaled that of the first. In fact, they sang 
in religious ceremonies that &#8220;although Malyari was powerful, Acasi had pre&euml;minence.&#8221; In an inferior order they worshiped also 
Manlobog or Mangalagan, whom they recognized as having power of appeasing irritated spirits. They rendered equal worship to 
five less important idols who represented the divinities of the fields, prosperity to their herds and harvests. They also 
believed that Anitong sent them rains and favorable winds; Damalag preserved the sown fields from hurricanes; Dumanga made 
the grain grow abundantly; and finally Calascas ripened it, leaving to Calosocos only the duty of harvesting the crops. They 
also had a kind of baptism administered by the Bayoc with pure blood of the pig, but this ceremony, very long and especially 
very expensive, was seldom celebrated in grand style. The sacrifice which the same priest offered to the idol Malyari consisted 
of ridiculous ceremonies accompanied by savage cries and yells and was terminated by repugnant debaucheries. 
</p> 
</div> 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1015">Of course it is impossible to tell how much of this is the product of the writer's imagination, or at least of the imagination 
of those earlier chroniclers from whom he got his information, but it can very well be believed that the natives had a religion 
of their own and that the work of the missionaries was exceedingly difficult. It was necessary to get them into villages, 
to show them how to prepare and till the soil and harvest the crops. And the writer concludes that &#8220;little by little the apathetic 
and indolent natives began to recognize the advantages of social life constituted under the shield of authority and law, and 
the deplorable effects of savage life, offering no guarantee of individual or collective security.&#8221; 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1018">A fortress had been built at Paynaven, in what is now the Province of Pangasinan, from which the work of the missionaries 
spread southward, so that the northern towns were all organized before those in the south. It is not likely that this had 
anything to do with causing <span id="d0e1020" class="pageno">page 27</span>the Negritos to leave the northern part of the province, if indeed they ever occupied it, but it is true that to-day they 
inhabit only the mountainous region south of a line drawn through the middle of the province from east to west. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1023">The friar Martinez Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga, speaking of the fortress at Paynaven, said that in that day, the beginning of the last century, 
there was little need of it as a protection against the &#8220;infidel Indians&#8221; and blacks who were very few in number, and against 
whom a stockade of bamboo was sufficient. 
<div class="blockquote"> 
<p id="d0e1027">It might serve against the Moros [he continues], but happily the Zambales coast is but little exposed to the attacks of these 
pirates, who always seek easy anchorage. The pirates are, however, a constant menace and source of danger to the Zambal, who 
try to transport on rafts the precious woods of their mountains and to carry on commerce with Manila in their little boats. 
The Zambal are exposed to attack from the Moros in rounding the point at the entrance of Manila Bay, from which it results 
that the province is poor and has little commerce.<a id="d0e1029src" href="#d0e1029" class="noteref">5</a> 
</p> 
</div> 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1035">Everything in the history of the Zambal people and their present comparative unimportance goes to show that they were the 
most indolent and backward of the Malayan peoples. While they have never given the governing powers much trouble, yet they 
have not kept pace with the agricultural and commercial progress of the other people, and their territory has been so steadily 
encroached on from all sides by their more aggressive neighbors that their separate identity is seriously threatened. The 
rich valleys of Zambales have long attracted Ilokano immigrants, who have founded several important towns. The Zambal themselves, 
owing to lack of communication between their towns, have developed three separate dialects, none of which has ever been deemed 
worthy of study and publication, as have the other native dialects of the Philippines. A glance at the list of towns of Zambales 
with the prevailing dialect spoken in each, and in case of nearly equal division also the second most important dialect, will 
show to what extent Zambal as a distinct dialect is gradually disappearing:

<p id="d0e1301">Of twenty-five towns Zambal is the prevailing dialect of less than half. As will be seen, the Ilokano have been the most aggressive 
immigrants. As a prominent Ilokano in the town of San Marcelino expressed it, when they first came they worked for the Zambals, 
who held all the good land. But the Zambal landowners, perhaps wanting money for a cockfight, would sell a small piece of 
land to some Ilokano who had saved a little money, and when he ran out of money he would sell a little more land, until finally 
the Ilokano owned it all. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1304">This somewhat lengthy and seemingly irrelevant sketch of the early history of Zambales and of the character of its inhabitants 
to-day is given to show the former state of savagery and the apathetic nature of the people who, in the days before the arrival 
of the Europeans, were in such close contact with the Negritos as to impose on them their language, and they have done it 
so thoroughly that no trace of an original Negrito dialect remains. Relations such as to-day exist between the people of the 
plains and those of the mountains would not change a dialect in a thousand years. Another evidence of a former close contact 
may be found in the fact that the Negritos of southern Zambales who have never personally come in contact with the Zambal 
but only with the Tagalog also speak Zambal with some slight variations, <span id="d0e1306" class="pageno">page 29</span>showing, too, that the movement of the Negritos has been southward away from the Zambal territory. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1309">Close study and special investigation into the linguistics of this region, carried also into Bataan and across the mountain 
into Pampanga and Tarlac, may throw more light on this very interesting and important subject and may reveal traces of an 
original Negrito dialect. Prominent natives of Zambales, whom I have questioned, and who are familiar with the subject, affirm 
that the Negritos know only the dialect of the Zambal. Indeed those are not lacking who believe in a blood relationship between 
the Negritos and the Zambal, but this belief can not be taken seriously.<a id="d0e1311src" href="#d0e1311" class="noteref">6</a> 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1393">Very little mention is made by the early writers of the Negritos. In fact they knew nothing of them except that they were 
small blacks who roamed in the mountains, living on roots and game which they killed with the bow and arrow. They were reported 
to be fierce little savages from whom no danger could come, since they did not leave their mountain fastnesses, but whose 
territory none dared enter. 
<span id="d0e1395" class="pageno">page 30</span> 
</p> 
<h2 id="d0e1399">Habitat of the Negritos</h2> 
<p id="d0e1404">As has been stated, the present range of the Negritos of this territory embraces the mountainous portion of the lower half 
of Zambales and the contiguous Provinces of Tarlac and Pampanga, extending southward even to the very extremity of the peninsula 
of Bataan. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1407">This region, although exceedingly broken and rough, has not the high-ridged, deep-canyoned aspect of the Cordillera Central 
of northern Luzon. It consists for the most part of rolling tablelands, broken by low, forest- covered ridges and dotted here 
and there by a few gigantic peaks. The largest and highest of these, Mount Pinatubo, situated due east from the town of Cabangan, 
holds on its broad slopes the largest part of the Negritos of Zambales. Many tiny streams have their sources in this mountain 
and rush down the slopes, growing in volume and furnishing water supply to the Negrito villages situated along their banks. 
Some of the larger of these streams have made deep cuts on the lower reaches of the mountain slopes, but they are generally 
too small to have great powers of erosion. The unwooded portions of the table-lands are covered with cogon and similar wild 
grasses. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1410">Here is enough fertile land to support thousands of people. The Negritos occupy practically none of it. Their villages and 
mountain farms are very scattered. The villages are built for the most part on the table-land above some stream, and the little 
clearings are found on the slope of the ridge at the base of which the stream runs. No use whatever is made of the grass-covered 
table-land, save that it offers a high and dry site for a rancheria, free from fevers. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1413">Practically all of the Negrito rancherias are within the jurisdiction of the two towns of Botolan and San Marcelino. Following 
the winding course of the Bucao River, 15 miles southeast from Botolan, one comes to the barrio of San Fernando de Riviera, 
as it is on the maps, or Pombato, as the natives call it. This is a small Filipino village, the farthest out, a half-way place 
between the people of the plains and those of the uplands. Here a ravine is crossed, a hill climbed, and the traveler stands 
on a plateau not more than half a mile wide but winding for miles toward the big peak Pinatubo and almost imperceptibly increasing 
in elevation. Low, barren ridges flank it on either side, at the base of each of which flows a good-sized stream. Seven miles 
of beaten winding path through the cogon grass bring the traveler to the first Negrito rancheria, Tagiltil, one year old, 
lying sun baked on a southern slope of the plateau. Here the plateau widens out, is crossed and cut up by streams and hills, 
and the forests gradually become thicker. In the wide reach of territory of which this narrow plateau is the western apex, 
including Mount Pinatubo and reaching to the Tarlac and Pampanga boundaries, there are situated no less than thirty rancherias 
of Negritos, having an average population of 40 persons or a <span id="d0e1415" class="pageno">page 31</span>total of more than 1,200. Besides these there are probably many scattered families, especially in the higher and less easily 
accessible forests of Mount Pinatubo, who live in no fixed spot but lead a wandering existence. And so uncertain are the habits 
of the more settled Negritos that one of the thirty rancherias known to-day may to-morrow be nothing more than a name, and 
some miles away a new rancheria may spring up. The tendency to remain in one place seems, however, to be growing. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1418">The mountainous portions of the jurisdictions of the two towns of Botolan and San Marcelino, themselves many miles apart with 
three or more towns between, are contiguous, the one extending southeast, the other northeast, until they meet. The San Marcelino 
region contains about the same number of Negritos, grouped in many small communities around five large centers&#8212;Santa F&eacute;, Aglao, 
Cabayan, Pa&ntilde;ibutan, and Timao&#8212;each of which numbers some 300 Negritos. They are of the same type and culture plane as those 
nearer Pi&ntilde;atubo, and their habitat is practically the same, a continuation of the more or less rugged Cordillera. They are 
in constant communication with the Negritos north of them and with those across the Pampanga line east of them. The Negritos 
of Aglao are also in communication with those of Subig, where there is a single rancheria numbering 45 souls. Still farther 
south in the jurisdiction of Olongapo are two rancherias, numbering about 100 people, who partake more of the characteristics 
of the Negritos of Bataan just across the provincial line than they do of those of the north. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1421">Here mention may be made also of the location of rancherias and numbers of Negritos in the provinces adjoining Zambales, as 
attention is frequently called to them later, especially those of Bataan, for the sake of comparison. Negritos are reported 
from all of the towns of Bataan, and there are estimated to be 1,500 of them, or about half as many as in Zambales. They are 
more numerous on the side toward Manila Bay, in the mountains back of Balanga, Orion, and Pilar. Moron and Bagac on the opposite 
coast each report more than a hundred. There is a colony of about thirty near Mariveles. Owing to repeated visits of tourists 
to their village and to the fact that they were sent to the Hanoi Exposition in 1903, this group has lost many of the customs 
peculiar to Negritos in a wild state and has donned the ordinary Filipino attire. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1424">Cabcabe, also in the jurisdiction of Mariveles, has more than a hundred Negritos, and from here to Dinalupijan, the northernmost 
town of the province, there are from 50 to 200 scattered in small groups around each town and within easy distance. Sometimes, 
as at Balanga, they are employed on the sugar plantations and make fairly good laborers. 
<span id="d0e1426" class="pageno">page 32</span> 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1429">The Negritos of Bataan as a whole seem less mixed with the Malayan than any other group, and fewer mixed bloods are seen among 
them. Their average stature is also somewhat lower. They speak corrupt Tagalog, though careful study may reveal traces of 
an original tongue. (See <a href="#d0e5343">Appendix B</a> for a vocabulary.) 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1435">In the section of Pampanga lying near Zambales Province more than a thousand Negritos have been reported from the towns of 
Florida Blanca, Porac, Angeles, and Mabalacat. There are estimated to be about 1,200 in Tarlac, in the jurisdiction of the 
towns of O'Donnell, Moriones, Capas, Bamban, and Camiling. There are two or three good trails leading from this province into 
Zambales by which the Negritos of the two provinces communicate with each other. It is proposed to convert the one from O'Donnell 
to Botolan into a wagon road, which will have the effect of opening up a little-known territory. Across. the line into Pangasinan 
near the town of Mangataren there is a colony of mixed Negritos somewhat more advanced in civilization than is usually the 
case with these forest dwellers. According to Dr. D. P. Barrows, who visited their rancherias in December, 1901, it seems 
to have been the intention of the Spanish authorities to form a reservation at that place which should be a center from which 
to reach the wilder bands in the hills and to induce them to adopt a more settled life. A Filipino was sent to the rancheria 
as a &#8220;maestro&#8221; and remained among the people six years. But the scheme fell through there as elsewhere in the failure of the 
authorities to provide homes and occupations for the Negritos. The Ilokano came in and occupied all the available territory, 
and the Negritos now hang around the Ilokano homes, doing a little work and picking up the little food thrown to them. Dr. 
Barrows states that the group contains no pure types characterized by wide, flat noses and kinky hair. In addition to the 
bow and arrows they carry a knife called &#8220;kampilan&#8221; having a wide-curving blade. They use this weapon in a dance called &#8220;baluk,&#8221; 
brandishing it, snapping their fingers, and whirling about with knees close to the ground. This is farther north than Negritos 
are found in Zambales but is in territory contiguous to that of the Tarlac Negritos. The entire region contains about 6,000 
souls. The groups are so scattered, however, that the territory may be said to be practically unoccupied.

<p mode="notetext"><a id="d0e1311" href="#d0e1311src" class="noteref">6</a> This was evidently the belief of some of the old voyagers. Navarette, whose account of his travels in 1647 is published in 
Churchill's Collection of Voyages, 1704, said that the people called &#8220;Zambales&#8221; were great archers and had no other weapons 
than the bow and arrow. Dr. John Frances Gemelli Careri, who made a voyage around the world, 1693&#8211;1697, says in his report 
(Churchill's Voyages, vol. IV): &#8220;This mixing [that is, of Negritos] with the Wild <i>Indians</i> produced the Tribe of <i>Manghian</i> who are Blacks dwelling in the Isles of Mindoro and Mundos [probably Panay], and who peopled the Islands <i>de los Negros,</i> or of Blacks. Some of them have harsh frisled hair like the <i>African</i> and <i>Angola</i> blacks. * * * 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1331" mode="notetext">&#8220;The <i>Sambali,</i> contrary to the others, tho' Wild have long Hair, like the other Conquer'd <i>Indians.</i> The Wives, of these Savages are deliver'd in the Woods, like She Goats, and immediately wash themselves and the Infants in 
the Rivers, or other cold Water; which would be immediate Death to <i>Europeans.</i> These Blacks when pursu'd by the <i>Spaniards,</i> with the sound of little Sticks, give notice to the rest, that are dispers'd about the Woods, to save themselves by Flight. 
Their Weapons are Bows and Arrows, a short Spear, and a short Weapon, or Knife at their Girdle. They Poison their Arrows, 
which are sometimes headed with Iron, or a sharp Stone, and they bore the Point, that it may break in their Enemies Body, 
and so be unfit to be shot back. For their defense, they use a Wooden Buckler, four Spans long, and two in breadth, which 
always hangs at their Arm. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1346" mode="notetext">&#8220;Tho' I had much discourse about it, with the Fathers of the Society, and other Missioners, who converse with these Blacks, 
<i>Manghians, Mandi</i> and <i>Sambali,</i> I could never learn any thing of their Religion; but on the contrary, all unanimously agree they have none, but live like 
Beasts, and the most that has been seen among the Blacks on the Mountains, has been a round Stone, to which they pay'd a Veneration, 
or a Trunk of a Tree, or Beasts, or other things they find about, and this only out of fear. True it is, that by means of 
the Heathen <i>Chineses</i> who deal with them in the Mountains, some deformed Statues have been found in their Huts. The other three beforemention'd 
Nations, seem'd inclin'd to observing of Auguries and <i>Mahometan</i> Superstitions, by reason of their Commerce, with the <i>Malayes</i> and <i>Ternates.</i> The most reciev'd Opinion is, that these Blacks were the first Inhabitants of the Islands; and that being Cowards, the Sea 
Coasts were easily taken from them by People resorting from <i>Sumatra, Borneo, Macassar</i> and other Places; and therefore they retir'd to the Mountains. In short, in all the Islands where these Blacks, and other 
Savage Men are, the <i>Spaniards</i> Possess not much beyond the Sea Coasts; and not that in all Parts, especially from <i>Maribeles,</i> to Cape <i>Bolinao</i> in the Island of <i>Manila,</i> where for 50 Leagues along the Shear, there is no Landing, for fear of the Blacks, who are most inveterate Enemies to the 
<i>Europeans.</i> Thus all the in-land Parts being possess'd by these Brutes, against whom no Army could prevail in the thick Woods, the King 
of <i>Spain</i> has scarce one In ten of the Inhabitants of the Island, that owns him, as the <i>Spaniards</i> often told me.&#8221;

<h1>Negritos of Zambales</h1> 
<h2 id="d0e1447">Physical Features</h2> 
<p id="d0e1452">The characteristics which serve more than any others to distinguish the true Negrito from other inhabitants of the Philippines 
are his small stature, kinky hair, and almost black skin. His eyes may be more round, his nose more short and flat, and his 
limbs more spindling than is the case with peoples of Malayan extraction, but these features are usually less noticeable. 
Perhaps undue emphasis has been given by writers on the Negrito to his short stature, until the impression has gone abroad 
that these primitive men are veritable dwarfs. As a matter of fact, individuals sometimes attain the stature of the shortest 
of the white men, and apparently only a slight infusion of Malayan blood is necessary to cause the Negrito to equal the Malay 
in, height. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1455">The Aeta of Zambales range in stature from 4 to 5 feet. To be more exact, the maximum height of the 77 individuals measured 
by me, taking them as they came, with no attempt to select, was 1,600 millimeters (5 feet 2 inches); the maximum height for 
females was 1,502 millimeters (4 feet 11 inches); the minimum height for males was 1,282 millimeters (4 feet 2 inches), for 
females, 1,265 millimeters (4 feet). The average of the 48 males measured was 1,463 millimeters (4 feet 9 inches); of the 
29 females, 1,378 millimeters (4 feet 6 inches). There is perhaps no greater variation between these figures than there would 
be between the averages of stature of as many individuals selected at random from any other race. Yet it should be remembered 
that some of the Negritos included in this list are not pure types&#8212;in fact, are no more than half-breeds. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1458">The abnormal length of the arm of the Negritos has been regarded by some writers as an essentially simian characteristic, 
especially in the case of the pygmy blacks of Central Africa. With the Aeta this characteristic is not so marked, yet 7 out 
of 8 males had a reach or span greater than the height. The proportion was not so large among the females, being only 2 in 
3. The maximum span for males was 1,635 millimeters, for females 1,538 millimeters, but in neither case did <span id="d0e1460" class="pageno">page 34</span>the individuals having the greatest span also have the greatest height. The average span of 48 males exceeded the average 
height by 37 millimeters; the difference in the case of the females was only 16 millimeters. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1463">Length of arm was taken on only 19 individuals, 16 males and 3 females. The longest arm measured 675 millimeters (2 feet 3 
inches), which is not so long as the average Caucasian arm, though more out of proportion to the height, in this case being 
nearly half the latter measurement. The shortest arm, that of an adult female, was 539 millimeters (21 inches). 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1466">So far from being ape like in appearance, some of the Aeta are very well-built little men, with broad chests, symmetrical 
limbs, and well-developed muscles hardened by incessant use. This applies of course only to the young men and boys just approaching 
manhood, and is especially noticeable in the southern regions, where the Aeta are generally more robust and muscular. The 
younger females are also as a rule well formed. In the case of unmarried girls the breasts are rounded and erect, but after 
marriage gradually become more and more pendant until they hang almost to the waist line. With advancing age the muscles shrink, 
the skin shrivels up until an individual of 40 to 50 years usually has the decrepit appearance of an octogenarian; in fact, 
50 is old age with the Aeta. (See plates.) 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1469">Anthropometric observations fall naturally into two groups, dealing with the proportions of the head and body, the latter 
of which have already been discussed. Great interest attaches also to the relative proportions of the different dimensions 
of the head and especially to the cephalic index obtained by multiplying the maximum breadth by 100 and dividing by the maximum 
length. Heads with an index of 75 or under are called <i>dolichocephalic;</i> those between 75 and 80, <i>mesaticephalic;</i> and those over 80 <i>brachycephalic.</i> The beads of the Aeta are essentially <i>brachycephalic.</i> Owing to the lack of proper calipers during the greater part of my stay among them, I was able to measure only 19 individuals, 
but of those all but 5 were in the <i>brachycephalic</i> group, one instance being noted where the index was as great as 92; the lowest was 78. The average of the males was 82 and 
of the females 86. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1487">Considerable importance in anthropometry is attached to the study of the nose. The typical Aeta nose may be described as broad, 
flat, bridgeless, with prominent arched al&aelig; almost as high as the central cartilage of the nose and with the nostrils invariably 
visible from the front. The nasal index obtained by dividing the nasal breadth by the height from the root of the nose to 
the septum and multiplying the quotient by 100 serves to indicate the group to which the individual belongs. Thus it will 
be seen that races with a nasal index of more than 100 have a nose wider than it is long. This is a marked characteristic 
of the Aeta. Of the 76 Aeta I measured, 25 were <i>ultraplatyrhinian</i>&#8212;that is, had a nasal index greater than 109. One individual, a <span id="d0e1492" class="pageno">page 35</span>female, showed the surprising index of 140.7, the greatest so far recorded to my knowledge. The greatest nasal index among 
the males was 130.7. Only one example of a <i>mesorhine</i> nose was noted, also of a female, and but 7 <i>platyrhine.</i> The most of them belonged in the <i>hyperplatyrhine</i> group. The following table will show the proper classification of the individuals measured by me:

</table> 
</p> 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1578">The shape of the eye varies from the round negroid of the pure bloods to the elongated mongoloid in the case of mixed types. 
The color of the eyes is a very dark brown or black. The lips are medium thick, far less thick than the lips of the African 
negro, and are not protruding. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1581">The hair of the Aeta is uniformly kinky in the case of the pure types. Individuals were noted with other negroid features 
but with curly hair, showing a probable mixture of blood. The hair grows low on the forehead and is very thick. Eyebrows are 
not heavy, save in particular instances, and beard is very scanty, though all adult males have some beard. There is very little 
body hair on adults of either Sex, except in the axillary and pubic regions, and it is scant even in these places. The northern 
Negritos have practically none in the armpits. Two or three old men were seen with a coating of hair over the back, chest, 
and legs. The head hair is uniformly of a dirty black color, in some instances sunburned on top to a reddish brown. It turns 
gray at a comparatively early age, and baldness is frequent. (See Pls. <a href="#d0e8032">XI</a>, <a href="#d0e8041">XII</a>, <a href="#d0e8050">XIII</a>, <a href="#d0e8059">XIV</a>, <a href="#d0e8068">XV</a>, <a href="#d0e8077">XVI</a>.) 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1602">In the case of women the hair is generally allowed to grow long, and in this tangled, uncombed state furnishes an excellent 
breeding place for vermin. However, if the vermin become troublesome the hair is sometimes cut short. (See <a href="#d0e8086">Pl. XVII</a>.) The cutting is done with the ever-useful bolo or sharp knife and is a somewhat laborious and painful process. Sometimes 
the hair may be cropped behind and left long on top. This is a favorite style of wearing it among the men, and is frequently 
followed by the women. Attempt is seldom made to comb the hair, but frequent vermin-catching onslaughts are made, the person 
performing the work using a sharp piece of bamboo to separate the tangled kinks and to mash the offending parasite against 
the <span id="d0e1607" class="pageno">page 36</span>thumb nail. In Bataan the Negritos sometimes shave a circular place on the crown, but I am not informed as to the reason. 
The practice is not followed in Zambales. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1610">The color of the skin is a dark chocolate brown rather than black, and on unexposed portions of the body approaches a yellowish 
tint of the Malayan. The loathsome skin disease common in the northern region of Luzon gives it a mottled appearance. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1613">The Aeta have practically no prognathism. The hands are not large, but the feet are larger in proportion to the size of the 
body than those of Filipinos. The toes are spreading, and the large toe frequently extends inward so much as to attract attention, 
though this can not be said to be a marked characteristic of all individuals. It may be caused by a constant practice of the 
tree climber&#8212;that of grasping a branch between the large toes and the other toes. I have seen Negrito boys who would use their 
feet in this respect as well as they used their hands. 
</p> 
<h2 id="d0e1617">Permanent Adornment</h2> 
<p id="d0e1622">The custom prevails throughout the entire Negrito territory of sharpening the teeth. Usually only the upper teeth are so treated, 
but numerous cases were noted where the teeth were sharpened both above and below, and still there were others where they 
were not sharpened at all. This sharpening is not performed at any certain age, and it is apparently not obligatory; I do 
not believe parents compel their children to submit to this practice. The object seems to be largely for the sake of adornment, 
but the Negritos say that sharpened teeth enable them to cat corn with greater ease. The sharpening is done by placing the 
blade of a bolo against the part of the tooth to be broken away and giving it a sharp rap with a piece of wood. The operation, 
called &#8220;ta-li-han,&#8221; is a somewhat delicate one, requiring care to prevent breaking through into the soft part of the tooth 
and exposing the nerve, and is no doubt practiced by only one or two persons in a group, though this fact could not be ascertained. 
Notwithstanding this mutilation, the teeth seem to be remarkably healthy and well preserved except in old age. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1625">In like manner each group of people possesses its scarifier, who by practice becomes adept. Scarification simply for purposes 
of ornamentation is not practiced to any great extent by the Negritos around Pinatubo. They burn themselves for curative purposes 
(see Chap. VI) and are sometimes covered with scars, but not the kind of scars produced by incisions. Only occasionally is the latter scarification 
seen near Pinatubo. In regions where it is common the work is usually done at the age of 15 or 16, although it may be done 
at any age. The incisions are made with a knife or a very sharp piece of cane, and generally follow some regular design. Scarification 
is called &#8220;ta-b&aacute;d,&#8221; and it <span id="d0e1630" class="pageno">page 37</span>has no other significance than adornment. The parts of the body usually marked are the breast, shoulders, and back, although 
scars are occasionally seen on the legs. 
</p> 
<h2 id="d0e1634">Clothing and Dress</h2> 
<p id="d0e1639">The clothing of the Negrito consists simply of the breechcloth and an occasional cast-off shirt given him by some Filipino 
in exchange for articles. Sometimes in cases of extreme prosperity he may possess a hat and a pair of trousers. The latter 
garment is usually worn, however, only by the chief man or &#8220;capit&aacute;n&#8221; of the tribe, and the rank and file wear only the breechcloth. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1642">A strip of cloth fastened around the waist and extending to the knees serves a woman for a dress. With unmarried girls this 
strip may be wound under the arms and so cover the breast. Rarely a short camisa is worn, but seldom do the camisa and the 
saya, or skirt, join. Sometimes, owing to the scarcity of cloth, a narrow strip will be worn over the breast, leaving a broad 
expanse of dark skin between it and the saya. (Pls. <a href="#d0e8194">XXIX</a> et seq.) 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1648">If given their choice among a variety of colors the Negritos always select black for their breechcloth and saya, because, 
they explain, the black will not show dirt as will other colors. Gaudy colors seem to attract and will be readily accepted 
as gifts if nothing else is at hand; yet I had some difficulty in disposing of a bolt of red cloth I had taken among them, 
and finally had to take the greater part of it back to the pueblo and exchange it for black. So far as I could learn the breechcloth 
and saya are never washed, and any cloth other than black would soon lose its original color. The cloth used by Negritos is 
procured in trade from the Christian towns. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1651">In the less easily accessible regions where the wilder Negritos live the breechcloth and saya are made of the inner bark of 
certain trees which is flayed until it becomes soft and pliable. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1654">The Negrito takes little pride in his personal appearance, and hence is not given to elaborate ornamentation. The women wear 
seed necklaces, called &#8220;col-in&#8242;-ta,&#8221; of black, white, and brown seeds, sometimes of a single solid color and sometimes with 
the colors alternating. I have also seen necklaces of small stones, hard berries of some sort, pieces of button or bone, and 
little round pieces of wood. Some women possess glass beads secured in trade from the Christianized natives. Often two or 
three white or black beads are used for ear ornaments, though it is not a very common practice to puncture the ears for this 
purpose as in Bataan, where leaves and flowers are often worn stuck in a hole through the lobe of the ear. What appears to 
be a necklace and really answers the purpose of such is a string of dried berries, called &#8220;a-mu-yong&#8242;,&#8221; which are said to 
be efficacious for the pangs of indigestion. (See <a href="#d0e8248">Pl. XXXV</a>.) When the Negrito feels a pain within <span id="d0e1659" class="pageno">page 38</span>him he pulls off a berry and eats it. One may see a string with just a few berries, and again a complete necklace of them, 
evidently just put on. These are worn by both sexes and are so worn for the sake of convenience as much as with the idea of 
ornamentation, for the Negrito has no pocket. Necklaces of fine woven strips of bejuco or vegetable fiber are sometimes seen 
but are not common. These strands are woven over a piece of cane, the lengthwise strands being of one color, perhaps yellow, 
and the crosswise strands black, giving a very pretty effect and making a durable ornament which the Negritos call &#8220;la-lao&#8242;.&#8221; 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1662">Hair ornaments are not generally worn, but nearly every Negrito, male and female, especially in southern Zambales and Bataan, 
possesses one or more of the so-called combs of bamboo. A single style prevails over the entire Negrito territory, differing 
only in minor details. A section of bamboo or mountain cane, varying in length from 5 to 10 inches, is split in thirds or 
quarters and one of these pieces forms the body of the comb. Teeth are cut at one end and the back is ornamented according 
to the taste of the maker by a rude carving. This carving consists simply of a series of lines or cuts, following some regular 
design into which dirt is rubbed to make it black. The combs may be further decorated with bright-colored bird feathers fastened 
with beeswax or gum to the concave side of the end which has no teeth. The feathers may be notched saw-tooth fashion and have 
string tassels fastened to the ends. In lieu of feathers horsehair and a kind of moss or other plant fiber are often used. 
The most elaborate decorations were noticed only in the north, while the combs of the south have either no ornamentation or 
have simply the hair or moss. These combs, which the Negritos call &#8220;hook&#8242;-lay,&#8221; are made and worn by both men and women, either 
with the tasseled and feathered ends directly in front or directly behind. (See <a href="#d0e8257">Pl. XXXVI</a>.) 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1668">Leglets of wild boars' bristles, called &#8220;a-y&aacute;-bun,&#8221; are more common in the south than in the north. These are made by taking 
a strip of bejuco and fastening the bristles to it so that they stand out at right angles to the leg of the wearer. They are 
used only by men and are worn on either leg, usually on the right just below the knee. The Negritos say these leglets give 
the wearer greater powers of endurance and are efficacious in making long journeys less tiresome. &#8220;For is not the wild boar 
the most hardy of all animals?&#8221; they ask. This idea is further carried out in the wearing of pieces of boars' skin with the 
hair attached, which may often be seen tied around the legs or wrists. Deerskin, which is quite as common among the Negritos, 
is never used in such fashion. Metal rings and bracelets are entirely unknown among the Negritos except where secured from 
the coast towns. (See <a href="#d0e8263">Pl. XXXVII</a>.) 
<span id="d0e1673" class="pageno">page 39</span> 
</p> 
<h2 id="d0e1678" class="abovehead">Chapter 4</h2> 
<h1>Industrial Life</h1> 
<h2 id="d0e1683">Home Life</h2> 
<p id="d0e1688">The general condition of the Negritos, although not one of extreme misery, is indeed pitiable. Their life is a continual struggle 
for sufficient food, but their efforts to provide for themselves stop short at that; clothing and houses are of secondary 
importance. The average Negrito takes little pride in his dwelling place. A shelter sufficient to turn the beating rains is 
all he asks. He sees to it that the hut is on ground high enough so that water will not stand in it; then, curled up beside 
his few coals of fire, he sleeps with a degree of comfort. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1691">The most easily constructed hut, and therefore the most common, consists simply of two forked sticks driven into the ground 
so they stand about 8 feet apart and 4 feet high. A horizontal piece is laid in the two forks, then some strips of bamboo 
are inclined against this crosspiece, the other ends resting on the ground. Some cross strips are tied with bejuco to these 
bamboos and the whole is covered with banana leaves. With the materials close at hand a half hour is sufficient for one man 
to construct such a shelter. Where a comparatively long residence in one place is contemplated more care may be given the 
construction of a house, but the above description will apply to many dwellings in a rancheria two or three years old. Instead 
of two upright pieces make it four, somewhat higher, and place a bamboo platform within so the occupants do not have to sleep 
on the ground, and you have an approved type of Negrito architecture. Sometimes as an adjunct to this a shelter may be erected 
in front, provided with a bamboo seat for the accommodation of visitors. The more prosperous Negritos in the long-established 
rancherias have four-posted houses of bamboo, with roof and sides of cogon grass. The floors are 4 feet from the ground and 
the cooking is done underneath the floors. A small fire is kept burning all night. The inmates of the house sleep just above 
it, and in this way receive some benefit of the warmth. If it were not for these fires the Negrito would suffer severely from 
cold during the night, for he possesses no blanket and uses no covering of any sort. 
<span id="d0e1693" class="pageno">page 40</span> 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1696">For two reasons he never lets his fire go out; first, because he likes to feel the warmth continually, and second, because 
it is something of a task to build a fire, once it has gone out. (See Pls. <a href="#d0e8269">XXXVIII</a>, <a href="#d0e8278">XXXIX</a>.) 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1705">The method of making fire used universally by the Negritos of Zambales is that of the flint and steel, which apparatus they 
call &#8220;pan&#8242;-ting.&#8221; The steel is prized highly, because it is hard to get; it is procured in trade from the Christianized natives. 
Nearly every Negrito carries a flint and steel in a little grass basket or case dangling down his back and suspended by a 
fiber string from his neck. In the same basket are usually tobacco leaves, buyo, and other small odds and ends. Sometimes 
this pouch is carried in the folds of the breechcloth, which is the only pocket the Negrito possesses. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1708">The flint-and-steel method of fire making has almost entirely supplanted the more primitive method of making fire by rubbing 
two sticks together; but in some instances this method is still followed, and everywhere the Negritos know of it. They do 
not know whether the method is original with them or, not, but they admit they borrowed the flint-and-steel idea from the 
Filipinos. When the friction process is employed a piece of bamboo with a hole in it, in which are firmly held some fine shavings 
or lint, is violently rubbed crosswise against the edge of another piece until the friction ignites the lint. It is called 
&#8220;pan-a-han&#8242;.&#8221; When two men are working together one holds the lower piece firmly while the other man rubs across it the sharpened 
edge of the upper piece. If a man is working alone the piece with the sharpened edge is held firmly between the ground and 
the man's waist; the other piece of bamboo with the slit in is rubbed up and down on the sharp edge. (See Pls. <a href="#d0e8287">XL</a>, <a href="#d0e8296">XLI</a>.) 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1717">In lieu of other vessels, rice and similar foods are cooked in joints of green bamboo, which are placed in the coals and hot 
ashes. When the food is cooked the bamboo is split open and the contents poured out on banana leaves. This is by far the most 
common method employed, though not a few Negritos possess earthenware pots, and some few have a big iron vessel. Meats are 
always roasted by cutting into small bits and stringing on a strip of cane. Maize is roasted on hot coals. Everything is eaten 
without salt, although the Negritos like salt and are very glad to get it. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1720">It has already been noted that the Negrito has a hard time to get enough to cat, and for that reason there is scarcely anything 
in the animal or vegetable kingdom of his environment of which he does not make use. He never has more than two meals a day, 
sometimes only one, and he will often start early in the morning on a deer hunt without having eaten any food and will hunt 
fill late in the afternoon. In addition to the fish, eels, and crayfish of the streams, the wild boar and wild chicken of 
the plain and woodland, he will eat iguanas and <span id="d0e1722" class="pageno">page 41</span>any bird he can catch, including crows, hawks, and vultures. Large pythons furnish especially toothsome steaks, so he says, 
but, if so, his taste in this respect is seldom satisfied, for these reptiles are extremely scarce. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1725">Besides rice, maize, camotes, and other cultivated vegetables there is not a wild tuber or fruit with which the Negrito's 
stomach is not acquainted. Even some that in their raw state would be deadly poisonous he soaks and boils in several waters 
until the poison is extracted, and then he eats them. This is the case with a yellow tuber which he calls &#8220;ca-lot&#8242;.&#8221; In its 
natural form it is covered with stiff bristles. The Negritos peel off the skin and slice the vegetable into very thin bits 
and soak in water two days, after which it is boiled in two or three waters until it has lost its yellow color. In order to 
see if any poison still remains some of it is fed to a dog, and if he does not die they themselves eat it. In taste it somewhat 
resembles cooked rice. This was told me by an old Negrito who I believe did not possess enough invention to make it up, and 
is in part verified by Mr. O. Atkin, division superintendent of Zambales, who says in a report to the General Superintendent 
of Education, October, 1903, concerning the destitution of the town of Infanta, that the people of that town were forced by 
scarcity of food to eat this tuber, there called &#8220;co-rot&#8242;.&#8221; He was told that it was soaked in running water five or six days 
before cooking, and if not prepared in this way it would cause severe sickness, even death. In fact, some cases were known 
where persons had died eating co-rot&#8242;. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1728">A white, thin-skinned tuber, called &#8220;bol&#8242;-wi,&#8221; which is found in the forests, is highly prized by the Negritos, although it 
grows so deep in the ground that the labor of digging it is considerable. Among the cultivated vegetables are the common butter 
beans, called &#8220;an-tak&#8242;,&#8221; and black beans, known as &#8220;an-tak&#8242; ik-no&#8242;&#8221; or &#8220;sitting-down beans&#8221; from the fact that the pods curl 
up at one end. Ga-bi and bau&#8242;-gan are white tubers, and u&#8242;-bi a dark-red tuber-which they eat. Other common products are maize, 
pumpkins, and camotes. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1731">The Negrito has ordinarily no table but the bare ground, and at best a coarse mat; he has no dishes but banana leaves and 
cocoanut shells, and no forks or spoons but his fingers. He brings water from a stream in a piece of bamboo about three joints 
long in which all but one joint has been punched out, and drinks it from a piece of cocoanut shell. If he needs to cut anything 
to eat he has his ever-ready bolo, which he may have used a moment before in skinning a pig and which is never washed. He 
is repulsively dirty in his home, person, and everything he does. Nothing is ever washed except his hands and face, and those 
only rarely. He never takes a bath, because he thinks that if he bathes often he is more susceptible to cold, that a covering 
<span id="d0e1733" class="pageno">page 42</span>of dirt serves as clothing, although he frequently gets wet either in the rain or when fishing or crossing streams. This is 
probably one reason why skin diseases are so common. 
</p> 
<h2 id="d0e1737">Agriculture</h2> 
<p id="d0e1742">The Negrito can not by any stretch of imagination be called a worker. His life for generations has not been such as to teach 
habits of industry. But for the fact that he has to do some work or starve, he would spend all his days in idleness except 
that time which he devoted to the chase. Yet when under pressure or urged on by anticipation of gain from the white man, whose 
wealth and munificence appear boundless, he is tireless. He will clear ground for a camp, cut and split bamboo, and make tables 
and sleeping platforms, which he would never think of doing for himself. He can get along without such things, and why waste 
the time? Yet when the camp is abandoned he will carry these things to his house. Most Negritos have seen the better style 
of living followed by the more civilized Filipinos in the outlying barrios; yet they seem to have no desire to emulate it, 
and I believe that the lack of such desire is due to a disinclination to perform the necessary manual labor. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1745">By far the greater part of the Negrito's energies are directed to the growing of tobacco, maize, and vegetables. He does not 
plant rice to any extent. All planting is done in cleared spots in the forest, because the soil is loose and needs no plowing 
as in the case of the lowland. The small trees and underbrush are cut away and burned and the large trees are killed, for 
the Negrito has learned the two important things in primitive farming-first, that the crops will not thrive in the shade, 
and second, that a tree too large to cut may be killed by cutting a ring around it to prevent the flow of sap. The clearings 
are never large. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1748">Usually each family has its clearing in a separate place, though sometimes two or more families may cultivate adjoining clearings. 
The places are selected with a view to richness of soil and ease in clearing. In addition to preparing the ground it is necessary 
to build a fence around the clearing in order to keep out wild hogs. A brush fence is constructed by thrusting sticks in the 
ground a few inches apart and twining brush between them. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1751">All work of digging up the soil, planting, and cultivating is done with sharpened sticks of hard wood, sometimes, but not 
always, pointed with iron, for iron is scarce. This instrument is called &#8220;ti-ad&#8242;,&#8221; the only other tool they possess being 
the bolo, with which they do all the cutting. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1754">Men, women, and children work in these clearings, but I did not see any division of labor, except that the men, being more 
adept with the bolo, do whatever cutting there is to be done. Once planted, the <span id="d0e1756" class="pageno">page 43</span>weeding and care of the crops falls largely on the women and children, while the men take their ease or hunt and fish. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1759">The piece of ground for planting is regarded as the personal property of the head of the family which cleared it, and he can 
sell it or otherwise dispose of it at his pleasure. No one else would think of planting on it even though the owner has abandoned 
it, unless he declared that he had no more use for it, then it could be occupied by anyone else. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1762">An instance of the respect which the Negritos have for the property rights of others was given me by a native of the town 
of Botolan. His grandfather had acquired a piece of land near Mount Pinatubo from a Negrito who had committed some crime in 
his rancheria and fled to the pueblo to escape death. In return for protection the Negrito had given him the land. This fact 
became known to the other Negritos, but although the new owner made no use of the land whatever, and never even visited it, 
it has never been molested or cultivated by others. Now two generations later they have sent down to the grandson of the first 
Filipino owner asking permission to buy the land. Land may be sold to others, but of course there exists no record of such 
transactions other than that of memory. 
</p> 
<h2 id="d0e1766">Manufacture and Trade</h2> 
<p id="d0e1771">The Negrito knows little of the art of making things. Aside from the bows and arrows which he constructs with some degree 
of skill he has no ingenuity, and his few other products are of the most crude and primitive type. The bows of the Negritos 
of Zambales are superior to any the writer has seen in the Philippines. They are made from the wood of the well-known <i>palma brava</i> and are gracefully cut and highly polished. The strings are of twisted bark, as soft and pliable and as strong as thongs 
of deerskin. Although made from the same wood, the bows of the Negritos of Negros are not nearly so graceful, and the strings 
consist simply of one piece of bejuco with a small loop at either end which slips over the end of the bow, and, once on, can 
neither be loosened nor taken up. The Negritos of Panay generally use a bamboo bow, much shorter and clumsier than those of 
<i>palma brava.</i> 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1780">Also, while the Negritos of the southern islands generally use arrows with hardwood points and without feathered shafts, those 
used in Zambales are triumphs of the arrow maker's art. In either case the shafts are of the light, hard, and straight mountain 
cane, but instead of the clumsy wooden points the Zambales Negritos make a variety of iron points for different purposes, 
some, as for large game, with detachable points. (See <a href="#d0e8305">Pl. XLII</a>.) The shafts are well feathered with the feathers of hawks and other large birds. Three feathers are placed about the arrow 
and securely wrapped at each end with a thin strip of bejuco or some strong grass. 
<span id="d0e1785" class="pageno">page 44</span> 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1788">The war arrows, in addition to having more elaborately barbed points, are further embellished by incised decorations the entire 
length of the shaft. These incisions consist simply of a series of lines into which dirt has been rubbed so that they offer 
a striking contrast to the white surface of the arrow. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1791">The women weave some coarse baskets out of bamboo, but they are neither well shaped nor pretty. Sometimes to adorn them one 
strand or strip of bamboo is stained black and the other left its natural color. Other objects of manufacture are their ornaments, 
already described in <a href="#d0e1442">Chapter III</a>, and musical instruments. (See <a href="#d0e2052">Chap. VI</a>.) 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1800">The Negrito knows that the people of the lowlands for some reason have more food than he. He can not go down and live there 
and work as they do, because, being timid by nature, he can not feel secure amid an alien people, and, besides, he likes his 
mountain too well to live contentedly in the hot plains. He makes nothing that the lowlands want, but he knows they use, in 
the construction of their houses, bejuco, of which his woods are full, and he has learned that they value beeswax, which he 
knows where to find and how to collect. Moreover, there are certain mountain roots, such as wild ginger, that have a market 
value. His tobacco also finds a ready sale to the Filipinos. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1803">The bolo is the only tool necessary to cut and strip the bejuco, which he ties into bunches of one hundred and takes into 
his hut for safety until such a time as a trade can be made. These bunches never bring him more than a peseta each. He collects 
the beeswax from a nest of wild bees which he has smoked out, melts it, and pours it into a section of bamboo. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1806">It is not always necessary that he take his products down to the town, for the Filipinos are eager enough to trade with him 
to go out to his rancheria carrying the little cloth, rice, iron, or steel that he is willing to take for his bard- gained 
produce. Perhaps the townspeople go out because they can drive better bargains. However that may be, the Negrito always gets 
the worst of the deal, whether in town or at his own home. 
</p> 
<h2 id="d0e1810">Hunting and Fishing</h2> 
<p id="d0e1815">The Negrito is by instinct, habits, and of necessity a hunter. Although he has advanced somewhat beyond that stage of primitive 
life where man subsists wholly from the fruits of the chase, yet it is so necessary to him that were he deprived of it the 
existence of his race would be seriously threatened. Since the chase has furnished him a living for centuries, it is not strange 
that much of the ingenuity he possesses should be devoted to the construction of arms and traps and snares with which he may 
kill or capture the creatures of the woods and streams. His environment does not supply a great variety of game, but there 
are always deer and wild boars in abundance. Then there <span id="d0e1817" class="pageno">page 45</span>are wild chickens and many birds which none but the Negrito would think of eating, and the mountain streams have a few small 
fish. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1820">It is the capture of the deer which makes the greatest demands on the Negrito's skill. Doubtless his first efforts in this 
direction were to lie in wait by a run and endeavor to get a shot at a passing animal. But this required an infinite amount 
of patience, for the deer has a keen nose, and two or three days might elapse before the hunter could get even a glimpse of 
the animal. So he bethought himself of a means to entrap the deer while he rested at home. At first he made a simple noose 
of bejuco so placed in the run that the deer's head would go through it and it would. close on his neck like a lasso. But 
this was not very effective. In the first place it was necessary that the run be of the right width with underbrush on either 
side, because if the noose were too large the deer might jump through it and if too small he might brush it to one side. 
<div id="d0e1822" class="divFigure">

</p> 
</div> 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1832">The results of this method were so uncertain that the practice has fallen into disuse. Recourse is now had to the deadly &#8220;belatic.&#8221; 
I do not believe that this trap, which is common nearly all over the Philippines, is original with the Negrito. It is probably 
the product of the Malayan brain. A trap almost identical with this and called &#8220;belantay&#8221; is described by Mr. Abraham Hale<a id="d0e1834src" href="#d0e1834" class="noteref">1</a> as belonging to the Sakai of the Malay Peninsula, whom the Philippine Negrito resembles in many ways. The similarity between 
the two words &#8220;belatic&#8221; and &#8220;belantay&#8221; is apparent. In Ilokano and Pampanga this trap is called &#8220;balantic,&#8221; accented, like 
the Sakai term, on the last syllable. In Tagalog and Bisayan the letter &#8220;n&#8221; is dropped and the word is pronounced &#8220;be-lat&#8242;-ic.&#8221; 
Mr. Hale does not state whether the word is Sakai or is borrowed from the Malay. But according to Clifford and Swettenham's 
Malay Dictionary the pure Malay term is &#8220;belante,&#8221; which, as it is even more <span id="d0e1837" class="pageno">page 46</span>similar to the terms in use in the Philippines, puts an end to the doubt concerning the origin of the word. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1840">The belatic consists of a long arrow or spear, which is driven, with all the force of a drawn bough or other piece of springy 
wood, across the path of the animal which strikes the cord, releasing the spring. (See <a href="#d0e1822">fig.&nbsp;1</a>.) 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1846">When the string C is struck it pulls the movable ring G, releasing K, which immediately flies up, releasing the string I and 
hence the spring F. The spear, which is usually tied to the end of the spring, though it may simply rest against it, immediately 
bounds forward, impaling the animal. The spring is either driven into the ground or is firmly held between the two uprights 
L. This trap is almost invariably successful. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1849">Wild chickens. and birds are caught with simple spring traps. The hungry bird tugging at an innocent-appearing piece of food 
releases a spring which chokes him to death. The noose snare for catching wild chickens invented by the Christianized natives 
is also used to some extent by the Negritos. This trap consists of a lot of small nooses of rattan or bejuco so arranged on 
a long piece of cane that assisted by pegs driven into the ground they retain an upright position. This is arranged in convex 
form against a wall or thicket of underbrush so that a bird can not enter the space thus inclosed except by way of the trap. 
In this inclosed area is placed a tame cock whose crowing attracts the wild one. The latter, spoiling for a fight, makes for 
the noisy challenger and runs his head through a noose which draws the tighter the more he struggles. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1852">The Negrito, as has been said, is remarkably ingenious in the construction of arrows. Those with which he hunts the deer are 
provided with cruelly barbed, detachable iron point. (Figs. 8, 9, <a href="#d0e8305">Pl. XLII</a>.) When the animal is struck the point leaves the shaft, unwinding a long woven coil with which the two are fastened together. 
The barbs prevent the point from tearing out of the flesh and the dangling shaft catches on the underbrush and serves to retard 
the animal's flight. In spite of this, however, the stricken deer sometimes gets away, probably to die a lingering death with 
the terrible iron point deeply imbedded in its flesh. A similar arrow is mentioned by De Quatrefages as having been found 
by Alan among the Mincopies of the Andamans.<a id="d0e1857src" href="#d0e1857" class="noteref">2</a> 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1861">The arrows which are used to kill smaller animals and birds have variously shaped iron heads without barbs. (Figs. 10, 11, 
12, 13, <a href="#d0e8305">Pl. XLII</a>.) However, in shooting small birds a bamboo arrow is used. One end is split a little way, 5 or 6 inches, into three, four, 
or five sections. These are sharpened and notched and are held apart by small wedges securely fixed by wrappings of cord. 
If the bird is not <span id="d0e1866" class="pageno">page 47</span>impaled on one of the sharp points it may be held in the fork. (Figs. 2, 3, 4, <a href="#d0e8305">Pl. XLII</a>.) The fish arrows have long, slender, notched iron points roughly resembling a square or cylindrical file. The points are 
from 4 to 8 inches in length. Sometimes they are provided with small barbs. (Figs. 5, 6, 7, <a href="#d0e8305">Pl. XLII</a>.) 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1875">The Negritos of Zambales are not so expert in the use of bows and arrows as their daily use of these weapons would seem to 
indicate. They seldom miss the larger animals at close range, but are not so lucky in shooting at small objects. I have noticed 
that they shoot more accurately upward into the trees than horizontally. For instance, a boy of 10 would repeatedly shoot 
mangoes out of a tree, but when I posted a mark at 30, yards and offered a prize for the best shot no one could hit it. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1878">The Negritos usually hunt in bands, and, because they have little else to do and can go out and kill a deer almost any time, 
they do not resort much to the use of traps. A long line of thirty men winding down the path from their village, all armed 
with bows twice their height and a handful of arrows, their naked bodies gleaming in the early morning sun, presents a truly 
novel sight. They have with them five or six half-starved dogs. When the haunts of the deer are reached, a big gully cutting 
through the level table-land, thick with cane and underbrush through which a tiny stream finds its way, half a dozen boys 
plunge into the depths with the dogs and the rest walk along either side or lie in wait at runs. The Negritos in the thicket 
yell continually and beat the brush, but the dogs are silent until game is scented. Then the cries of the runners are redoubled 
and the din warns those lying in wait to be alert. Presently from one of the many runs leading out of the ravine a deer appears 
and, if there happens to be a Negrito on the spot, gets an arrow. But, unless vitally wounded, on he goes followed by the 
dogs, which never give up the chase of a wounded deer. When a deer is killed it is hung up in a tree and the hunt proceeds. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1881">Sometimes the thick canebrakes along the river beds are beaten up in this way, or the lightly timbered mountain ravines; for 
the Negrito knows that the deer lie in a cool, sheltered place in the daytime and come forth to browse only at night. On clear, 
moonlight nights they sometimes attempt to stalk the deer while grazing in the open field, but are not usually successful. 
Quite often in the chase a long rope net, resembling a fish net but much coarser and stronger, is placed in advance of the 
beating party in some good position where the deer is likely to run if started up. These are absolutely sure to hold the deer 
should the unfortunate animal run into them&#8212;a thing which does not happen often. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1884">The Negritos are tireless in the chase. They will hunt all day without eating, unless they happen to run across some wild 
fruit. Women <span id="d0e1886" class="pageno">page 48</span>frequently take part, especially if dogs are scarce, and they run through the brush yelping to imitate the dogs. But they 
never carry or use the bows and arrows. This seems to be the especial privilege of the men. Boys from an early age are accustomed 
to their use and always take part in the hunt, sometimes performing active service with their little bows, but girls never 
touch them. Not infrequently the runners in the brush emerge carrying wild pigs which they have seared up and killed, and 
if, by chance, a big snake is encountered, that ends the hunt, for the capture of a python is an event. The snake is killed 
and carried in triumph to the village, where it furnishes a feast to all the inhabitants. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1889">This sketch of hunting would not be complete without mention of a necessary feature of every successful hunt-the division 
of the spoils. When the hunt is ended the game is carried back to the village before the division is made, provided the hunters 
are all from the same place. If two or more villages have hunted together the game is divided in the field. A bed of. green 
rushes or cane is made on which the animal is placed and skinned. This done, the bead man of the party, or the most important 
man present, takes a small part of the entrails or heart, cuts it into fine bits and scatters the pieces in all directions, 
at the same time chanting in a monotone a few words which mean &#8220;Spirits, we thank you for this successful hunt. Here is your 
share of the spoils.&#8221; This is done to feed and appease the spirits which the Negritos believe inhabit all places, and the 
ceremony is never neglected. Then the cutting up and division of the body of the animal takes place. The head and breast go 
to the man who first wounded the deer, and, if the shot was fatal, he also receives the backbone&#8212;this always goes to the man 
who fired the fatal shot. One hind quarter goes to the owner of the dog which seared up the deer, and the rest is divided 
as evenly as possible among the other hunters. Every part is utilized. The Negritos waste nothing that could possibly serve 
as food. The two hunts I accompanied were conducted in the manner I have related, and I was assured that this was the invariable 
procedure. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1892">The mountain streams of the Negrito's habitat do not furnish many fish, but the Negrito labors assiduously to catch what he 
can. In the larger streams he principally employs, after the manner of the Christianized natives, the bamboo weir through 
which the water can pass but the fish can not. In the small streams he builds dams of stones which he covers with banana leaves. 
Then with bow and arrow he shoots the fish in the clear pool thus formed. Not infrequently the entire course of a creek will 
be changed. A dam is first made below in order to stop the passage of the fish, and after a time the stream is dammed at some 
point above in such a way as to change the current. Then, as the water slowly runs out of the part thus cut off, any fish 
remaining are easily caught.

<p id="d0e1909">A gambling game was the only thing observed among the Negritos of Zambales which had the slightest resemblance to a game. 
Even the children, who are playful enough at times, find other means of amusing themselves than by playing a systematic game 
recognized as such and having a distinct name. However, they take up the business of life, the quest for food, at too early 
an age to allow time, to hang heavy, and hence never feel the need of games. Probably the fascination of bow and arrow and 
the desire to kill something furnish diversion enough for the boys, and the girls, so far as I could see, never play at all. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1912">The game of dice, called &#8220; sa&#8242;-ro,&#8221; is universal. Instead of the familiar dots the marks on the small wooden cubes are incised 
lines made with a knife. These lines follow no set pattern. One pair of dice which I observed were marked as shown in <a href="#d0e1917">fig. 2</a>. The player has five chances, and if he can pair the dice one time out of five he wins, otherwise he loses. Only small objects, 
such as camotes, rough-made cigars, or tobacco leaves, are so wagered. A peculiar feature of the game is the manner in which 
the dice are thrown. The movement of the arm is an inward sweep, which is continued after the dice leave the hand, until the 
hand strikes the breast a resounding whack; at the same time the player utters a sharp cry much after the manner of the familiar 
negro &#8220;crap shooter.&#8221; The Negritos do not know where they got the game, but say that it has been handed down by their ancestors. 
It might be thought that the presence of a negro regiment in the province has had something to do with it, but I was assured 
by a number of Filipinos who have long been familiar with the customs of the Negritos that they have had this game from the 
first acquaintance of the Filipinos with them.

</div> 
</p> 
<h2 id="d0e1925">Music</h2> 
<p id="d0e1930">In their love for music and their skill in dancing Negritos betray other striking Negroid characteristics. Their music is 
still of the most primitive type, and their instruments are crude. But if their notes are few no fault can be found with the 
rhythm, the chief requisite for an accompaniment to a dance. Their instruments are various. The simple jew's-harp cut from 
a piece of bamboo and the four-holed flutes (called &#8220;ban&#8242;-sic&#8221;) made of mountain cane (figs. 6, 7, <a href="#d0e8338">Pl. XLVI</a>) are very common but do not rise to the dignity of dance instruments. Rarely a bronze going (fig. 1, <a href="#d0e8338">Pl. XLVI</a>), probably of Chinese make, has made its way into Negrito hands and is highly prized, but these are not numerous&#8212;in fact, 
none was seen in the northern region, but in southern Zambales and Bataan they are occasionally used in dances. The most common 
instrument is the bamboo violin. (Fig. 2, <a href="#d0e8338">Pl. XLVI</a>.) It is easy to make, for the materials are ready at hand. A section of bamboo with a joint at each end and a couple of holes 
cut in one side furnishes the body. A rude neck with pegs is fastened to one end and three abac&aacute; strings of different sizes 
are attached. Then with a small bow of abac&aacute; fiber the instrument is ready for use. No attempt was made to write down the 
music which was evolved from this instrument. It consisted merely in the constant repetition of four notes, the only variation 
being an occasional. change of key, but it was performed in excellent time. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1942">Rude guitars are occasionally found among the Negritos. They are made of two pieces of wood; one is hollowed out and has a 
neck carved at one end, and a flat piece is glued to this with gum. These instruments have six strings. If a string breaks 
or becomes useless it is only a question of cutting down a banana stalk and stripping it for a new one. These guitars and 
violins are by no means common, though nearly every village possesses one. The ability to play is regarded as an accomplishment. 
A stringed instrument still more primitive is made from a single section of bamboo, from which two or three fine strips of 
outer bark are split away in the center but are still attached at the ends. These strips are of different lengths and are 
held apart from the body and made tight with little wedges. (Figs. 4, 5, <a href="#d0e8338">Pl. XLVI</a>.) Another instrument is made by stretching fiber strings over bamboo tubes, different tensions producing different tones. 
(Figs. 8, 9, <a href="#d0e8338">Pl. XLVI</a>.) These simpler instruments are the product of the Negrito's own brain, but they have probably borrowed the idea of stringed 
violins and guitars from the Christianized natives. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1951">The Negritos of the entire territory have but two songs, at least so they affirmed, and two were all I heard. Strange as it 
may seem, at least one of these is found at both the extreme ends of the region. An extended acquaintance with them might, 
and probably would, reveal <span id="d0e1953" class="pageno">page 52</span>which are performed oil any occasion such as the setting up of my tent, there are several mimetic dances having a special 
character or meaning. Such are the potato dance, the bee dance, the torture dance, the lover's dance, and the duel dance. 
(See Pls. <a href="#d0e8353">XLVIII</a>, <a href="#d0e8362">XLIX</a>.) 
</p> 
<h3 id="d0e1962">The Potato Dance, or Pi&ntilde;a Camote</h3> 
<p id="d0e1967">Only one person takes part in the potato dance. At first the performer leaps into the open space and dances around in a circle, 
clapping his hands as if warming up, the usual preliminary to all the dances. Presently in pantomime he finds a potato patch, 
and goes through the various motions of digging the potatoes, putting them in a sack, and throwing the sack over his shoulder, 
all the time keeping close watch to prevent his being caught In the act of stealing. He comes to the brush fence which surrounds 
every &#8220;cai&ntilde;gin,&#8221; draws his bolo, cuts his way through, and proceeds until he comes to a river. This is significant as showing 
that the potato patch he is robbing does not belong to anyone in his own village but is across a river which he must pass 
on his way home. He sounds for deep water with a stick. It is too deep, and he tries another place. Here he loses his footing, 
drops his sack, and the swift current carries it beyond his reach. While going through the various motions necessary to depict 
these actions the movement of the dance is kept up, the body bent forward in a crouching position, the feet leaving the ground 
alternately in rapid motion but never out of time with the music. Such agility and tirelessness one could scarcely find anywhere 
else. 
</p> 
<h3 id="d0e1971">The Bee Dance, or Pi&ntilde;a Pa-ni-lan</h3> 
<p id="d0e1976">This dance is also performed by one person and in a similar manner as the potato dance. A piece of cloth tied to a pole serves 
as a nest of bees. The performer dances around the circle several times; presently he spies the nest and approaches slowly, 
shading his eyes for a better view. Having satisfied himself that he has really made a find, he lights a smudge, goes through 
the motion of climbing the tree, and in holding the smudge under the nest he is stung several times and has to retreat. This 
is repeated until all the bees are smoked out and the honey is gathered. Then comes a feast in which, drunk with honey, he 
becomes hilarious. 
</p> 
<h3 id="d0e1980">The Torture Dance</h3> 
<p id="d0e1985">This dance, which commemorates the capture of an enemy, is performed in much the same manner as the &#8220;talbun&#8221; except that there 
is no song connected with it. The captive is bound to a stake in the center and a dozen men circle slowly around him, in the 
same manner as already described, one hand over the mouth and uttering long-drawn notes. <span id="d0e1987" class="pageno">page 53</span>more songs, but they are reluctant to sing before white men. One of these songs, called &#8220;du-nu- ra,&#8221; is a kind of love song. 
Owing to the extreme embarrassment of the performer I was able to hear it only by going into my tent where I could not see 
the singer. It consisted of a great many verses-was interminable, in fact. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1990">The second of the two songs was called &#8220;tal-bun&#8242;.&#8221; This is sung on festive occasions, especially when visitors come. The words 
are improvised to suit the occasion, but the tune and the manner of rendering never vary. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e1993">Five or six men, each holding with one hand the flowing end of the breechcloth of the one in front or with the hand on his 
shoulder and the other hand shading the mouth, walk slowly about a circle in a crouching posture, their eyes always cast on 
the ground. Presently the leader strikes a note, which he holds as long as possible and which the others take up as soon as 
he has sounded it. This is kept up a few minutes, different tones being so sounded and drawn out as long as the performers 
have breath. The movement becomes more rapid until it is nearly a run, when the performers stop abruptly, back a few steps, 
and proceed as before. After they have about exhausted the gamut of long-drawn &#8220;O's&#8221; they sing the words, usually a plea for 
some favor or gift, being first sung by the leader and repeated after him by the chorus. I did not get the native words of 
the song I heard, but it was translated to me as follows: 
<div class="blockquote"> 
<p id="d0e1997">We are singing to the American to show him what we can do; perhaps if we sing well he will give us some rice or some cloth.</p> 
</div> 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2002">The words are repeated over and over, with only the variation of raising or lowering the tone. At intervals all the performers 
stop and yell at the top of their voices. Sometimes a person on the outside of the circle will take up the strain on a long-held 
note of the singers. This song also serves for festive occasions, such as weddings. (See <a href="#d0e8344">Pl. XLVII</a>.) 
</p> 
<h2 id="d0e2010">Dancing</h2> 
<p id="d0e2015">Dancing forms the chief amusement of the Negritos and allows an outlet for their naturally exuberant spirits. I had no more 
than set, up camp near the first rancheria I visited than I was entertained by dancing. Among the Negritos helping me was 
one with an old violin, and as soon as a place was cleared of brush and the tent was up he struck up a tune. Whereupon two 
or three youngsters jumped out and performed a good imitation of a buck-and-wing dance. However, dancing is not generally 
indulged in by everybody, but two or three in every rancheria are especially adept at it. Aside from the general dances, called 
&#8220;ta-li&#8242;-pi,&#8221; which consist of a series of heel-and-toe movements in excellent time to the music of violin or guitar, and the movement becomes faster and faster until it consists wholly of frenzied leaps, and the performers, worked up to the proper 
pitch draw their bolos, close in on their victim, and slash him to pieces. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2021">When executed at night in the light of a bonfire this dance is most grotesque and terrible. The naked black bodies, gleaming 
in the fire, the blood-curdling yells, and the demoniacal figures of the howling, leaping dancers, remind one of the Indian 
war dances. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2024">The dance seems to be a relic of more barbarous days when the Negritos were, in truth, savages. They say that they never kill 
a prisoner in this manner now, but that when they find it necessary to put a man to death they do it in the quickest manner 
possible with a single blow of the knife. (See <a href="#d0e8371">Pl. L</a>.) 
</p> 
<h3 id="d0e2030">The Lovers' Dance</h3> 
<p id="d0e2035">As might be expected, a man and a woman take part in the lovers' dance. The women are not such energetic and tireless dancers 
as the men, and in the lovers' dance the woman, although keeping her feet moving in time to the music, performs in an indolent, 
passive manner, and does not move from the spot where she begins. But the man circles about her, casting amorous glances, 
now coming up quite close, and then backing away again, and at times clapping his hands and going through all sorts of evolutions 
as if to attract the woman. This sort of thing is kept up until one or both are tired. 
</p> 
<h3 id="d0e2039">The Duel Dance</h3> 
<p id="d0e2044">The duel dance is by far the most realistic and interesting of any of the Negrito dances. Is the name suggests, the dance, 
is performed by two men, warriors, armed with bows and arrows and bolos. An oblong space about 8 feet in width and 15 feet 
long serves as an arena for the imaginary conflict. After the musician has got well into his tune the, performers jump into 
either end of the space with a whoop and a flourish of weapons, and go through the characteristic Negrito heel-and-toe movement, 
all the time casting looks of malignant hate at each, other but each keeping well to his end of the ring. Then they advance 
slowly toward each other, swinging the drawn bow and arrow into play as if to shoot, then, apparently changing their minds 
or the opportunity not being good for a death shot, they withdraw again to the far ends of the ring. Advancing once more each 
one throws the drawn bow and arrow upward, then toward the ground, calling heaven and earth to witness his vow to kill the 
other. Presently one gets a favorable opportunity, his bowstring twangs, and his opponent falls to the ground. The victor 
utters a cry of triumph, dances up to the body of his fallen foe, and cuts off the head with his bolo. He beckons and cries 
out to the relatives of the dead man to come and avenge the deed. Nobody <span id="d0e2046" class="pageno">page 54</span>appearing, he bears aloft the head of the enemy, shouting exultingly and triumphantly as if to taunt them to respond. Still 
no one comes. Then alter waiting and listening for a time he replaces the head with the trunk and covers the body over with 
leaves and dirt. This ends the dance. Ordinarily it requires fifteen minutes for the full performance. During this time the 
one who by previous arrangement was to be the victor never for a single instant pauses or loses step. 
</p> 
<h2 id="d0e2052" class="abovehead">Chapter 6</h2> 
<h1>General Social Life</h1> 
<h2 id="d0e2057">The Child</h2> 
<p id="d0e2062">I was unable to learn anything in support of Montano's statement that immediately after the birth of a child the mother rushes 
to a river with it and plunges into the cold water.<a id="d0e2064src" href="#d0e2064" class="noteref">1</a> On the contrary, the child is not washed at all until it is several days old, and the mother does not go to the stream until 
at least two days have elapsed. It is customary to bury the placenta. The birth of a child is not made the occasion of any 
special festivity. The naming is usually done on the day of birth, but it may be done any time within a few days. It is not 
common for the parents of the child to do the naming, though they may do so, but some of the old people of the tribe generally 
gather and select the name. Names of trees, objects, animals, places near which the child was born, or of certain qualities 
and acts or deeds all furnish material from which to select. For instance, if a child is born under a guijo tree he may be 
called &#8220;Guijo;&#8221; a monkey may be playing in the tree and the child will be named &#8220;Barac&#8221; (monkey); or if the birth was during 
a heavy rain the child may be called &#8220;Layos&#8221; (flood). Usually the most striking object near at hand is selected. Like most 
primitive peoples, the Negritos use only one name. If the child is sickly or cries very much, the name is changed, because 
the Negritos believe that the spirit inhabiting the place where the child was born is displeased at the choice of the name 
and takes this means of showing its displeasure, and that if the name is not changed the child will soon die. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2068">Apparently no distinction is made between the names for the two sexes. The child may be given the name of the father, to whose 
name the word &#8220; pan,&#8221; meaning elder, is prefixed for the sake of distinction. For instance, if a man named Manya should have 
either a son or a daughter the child might be called Manya, and the father would henceforth be known as Pan-Manya. This practice 
is very common, and when names like Pan-Benandoc, Pan-Turico, and Pan-Palaquan&#8242; are <span id="d0e2070" class="pageno">page 56</span>encountered it may be regarded as a certainty that the owners of these names have children of the same name without the prefix. 
Although one may change his name at any time of life, if the years of infancy are safely passed, no change is likely to be 
made. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2073">It is regarded as a sign of disrespect to address elders or superiors by name. The word &#8220;pan&#8221; alone is frequently used. Relatives 
are addressed by the term which shows the relationship, as &#8220;anac&#8221; (son), and names are used only when speaking of persons 
and seldom if ever when speaking to them. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2076">Parents seem to have great affection for their children, but exact obedience from them. Punishment is inflicted for small 
offenses, striking with the hand being the usual method. I have never seen a switch used. Sometimes, as in cases of continual 
crying, the child is severely pinched in the face or neck. Children also exhibit great affection for their parents; this continues 
through life, as is shown in the care which the aged receive at the hands of their juniors. (See Pls. <a href="#d0e8380">LI</a> et seq.) 
</p> 
<h2 id="d0e2083">Marriage</h2> 
<p id="d0e2088">Whatever differences there may be in the manner of conducting the preliminaries to a wedding and of performing the ceremony, 
there is one feature that never varies, the gift of some articles of value from the prospective bridegroom to the parents 
of the girl he wishes to marry. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2091">With the Negritos a daughter is regarded as an asset of so much value, not to be parted with until that price is paid, and, 
while she is allowed some freedom in the choice of a husband, parental pressure usually forces her to the highest bidder. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2094">The following is the customary procedure: The young man who wishes to marry and has found a girl to suit him informs his parents 
of the fact. He has probably already talked the matter over with the girl, though not necessarily so. The affair is discussed 
in the family of the suitor, the main topic being how much the girl is worth and how much they can afford to pay. Then either 
the suitor or some relative acting for him goes to the parents of the girl to ask if the suit will be favorably considered. 
If it will, they return and a few days later go again bearing presents of tobacco, maize, bejuco, knives, cloth, forest products, 
or anything else they may happen to have. If these gifts are of sufficient value to compensate the father for the loss of 
his girl, he gives his consent. Value is determined by the attractiveness of a girl and hence the probability of her making 
a good match, also by her health and strength, as women are good workers on the little farms. If the first gifts do not come 
up to the demands of the girl's parents the wedding can not take place until the amount lacking is made up. As to the money 
value of these gifts I have been told different things by Negritos in different villages, the values given ranging from 25 
pesos to 500 pesos.As a matter of fact this means <span id="d0e2096" class="pageno">page 57</span>nothing, for the Negrito's idea of value as measured by pesos is extremely vague; but there is no doubt that the gifts made 
represent almost all the wealth of which a young man and his family can boast. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2099">This system of selling girls, for that is what it amounts to, is carried to an extreme by parents who contract their daughters 
at an early age to the parents of some boy, and the children are regarded as man and wife, though of course each remains with 
the parents until the age of puberty is reached. Whether or not the whole payment is made in the beginning or only enough 
is paid to bind the bargain, I do not know, but I do know that cases of this kind may be met with frequently among the Negritos 
of Pinatubo, who give as an excuse that the girl is thus protected from being kidnapped by some neighboring tribe, the relatives of the boy making common cause with those of the girl in case anything like this 
should happen. It seems more likely, however, that the contract is simply a desire on the part of the parents of the girl 
to come into early possession of the things which are paid for her, and of the parents of the boy to get her cheaper than 
they could by waiting until she was of marriageable age. This practice is not met with in southern Zambales and Bataan, where 
marriage does not seem to partake so much of the nature of a sale but where presents are nevertheless made to a girl's parents. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2105">If it happens that there is a young man in the girl's family who is seeking a wife in that of the boy, an even exchange may 
be made and neither family has to part with any of its possessions. I was told also that in lieu of other articles a young 
man might give a relative to the bride's family, who was to remain as a sort of slave and work for his master until he was 
ransomed by payment of the necessary amount; or he might buy a person condemned to death and turn him over at an increased 
price, or sell children stolen from another barrio. As a bride may be worth as much as 500 pesos and a slave never more than 
40 pesos, it would seem necessary to secure several individuals as payment. This was told me more than once and in different 
villages, but I was unable to find any examples, and am forced to conclude that if it ever was the practice, it is no longer 
so, at least among the &#8220;conquistas.&#8221; As to the true savages, still lurking in the inmost recesses of the Zambales mountains, 
I am unable to say. The question of slavery among Negritos is reserved to another chapter. 
</p> 
<h3 id="d0e2108">Rice Ceremony</h3> 
<p id="d0e2113">All the preliminaries having been satisfactorily attended to, it remains only to perform the ceremony. This proceeding varies 
in different sections from practically no ceremony at all in the Pinatubo region to a rather complicated performance around 
Subig and Olongapo. In some of the northern villages, when the matter of payment has been <span id="d0e2115" class="pageno">page 58</span>arranged, a feast and dancing usually follow, in which all the relatives of both families participate, and after this the 
couple go to their own house. There may be two feasts on succeeding days, one given by the parents of the boy to the relatives 
of the girl, and vice versa. If only one feast is given both families contribute equally in the matter of food. No single 
act can be pointed out as constituting a ceremony. In other places, especially at Cabayan and Aglao, near Santa F&eacute;, an exchange 
of food between the pair is a necessary part of the performance. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2118">A mat is placed on the ground, and in the center is set a dish of cooked rice or some other food. The pair seat themselves 
on either side of the dish, facing each other, while all the relatives and spectators crowd around. The man takes a small 
piece of the food and places it in the mouth of the girl, and she does the same for the man. At this happy conclusion of the 
affair all the people around give a great shout. Sometimes the girl leaps to her feet and runs away pursued by her husband, 
who calls after her to stop. This she does after a little, and the two return together; or they may take a bamboo tube used 
for carrying water and set off to the river to bring water for the others to drink, thus performing in unison the first act 
of labor of their married life. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2121">I was fortunate enough to witness a ceremony where the exchange of food was the important feature. In this instance a piece 
of brown bread which I was about to throw away served as the wedding cake. It seems that the girl had been contracted by her 
parents when very young to a man old enough to be her father, and when the time for the wedding arrived she refused to have 
anything to do with it. For two years she had resisted entreaties and threats, displaying more force of will than one would 
expect from a Negrito girl of 15. The man had paid a large price for her&#8212;200 pesos, he said&#8212;and the girl's parents did not 
have it to return to him. It was suggested that if we made her some presents it might induce her to yield. She was presented 
with enough cloth for two or three camisas and sayas, a mirror, and a string of beads, and she finally gave an unwilling assent 
to the entreaties of her relatives, and the ceremony was performed in the manner already described. At the conclusion a yell 
went up from the assembly, and I, at the request of the capit&aacute;n, fired three pistol shots into the air. Everybody seemed satisfied 
except the poor girl, who still wept furtively over her new treasures. Some days later, however, when I saw her she appeared 
to be reconciled to her fate, and was happy in the possession of more valuables than any other woman in the rancheria. 
</p> 
<h3 id="d0e2125">Head Ceremony</h3> 
<p id="d0e2130">In the southern rancherias a bamboo platform is erected 20 or 30 feet high, with a ladder leading up to it from the ground. 
On the day fixed for the marriage the groom, accompanied by his parents, goes <span id="d0e2132" class="pageno">page 59</span>to the house of the bride and asks for her. They are usually told that she has gone away, but some small gifts are sufficient 
to have her produced, and the whole party proceeds to the place of marriage. Here bride and groom mount the ladder&#8212;some accounts 
say the bride is carried up by her prospective father-in-law. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2135">An old man of the tribe, and, if the platform be large enough, also the parents of the pair, go up and squat down in the rear. 
The bride and bridegroom also squat down facing each other, and the old man comes forward and knocks their heads together. 
I was told at Subig that only the bride and groom mount the platform and seat themselves for a talk, the relatives remaining 
below facing each other with drawn weapons. If by any chance the pair can not agree, it means a fight. But if they do agree, 
they descend from the platform and the head bumping completes the ceremony. This is an extremely unlikely story, probably 
the product of Malayan imagination. 
</p> 
<h3 id="d0e2139">&#8220;Leput,&#8221; or Home Coming</h3> 
<p id="d0e2144">After the ceremony has been performed the newly wedded pair return to the home of the girl's parents where they remain a few 
days. When the husband possesses enough gifts for his bride to fulfill the requirements of the leput that important event 
takes place. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2147">Although the writer heard repeated accounts of this ceremony in southern Zambales he never had an opportunity to witness it. 
However, the leput is described as follows by Mr. C. J. Cooke, who saw it in Bataan:<a id="d0e2149src" href="#d0e2149" class="noteref">2</a> 
<div class="blockquote"> 
<p id="d0e2154">The bride had already left the home of her mother and formed the center of a group passing through a grove of heavy timber 
with very little underbrush. The evening sun cast strange shadows on the weird procession as it moved snakelike along the 
narrow path. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2157">Occasionally there would be short stops, when the bride would squat to receive some bribes or tokens from her husband, his 
relatives, or friends. Nor would she move until she received something each time she elected to stop. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2160">Clad in a bright-red breechcloth and extra-high silk hat was the capit&aacute;n who headed the procession. He carried a silver-headed 
cane. Next in order came some of the elders of both sexes. Then came the bride attended by four women and closely followed 
by her husband, who also had a like number of attendants. Last came the main body, all walking in single file. Two musicians 
were continually executing a running dance from one end of the procession to the other and always keeping time with their 
crude drums or copper gongs, the noise of which could be heard for miles around. Whenever they passed the bride they would 
hold the instruments high in the air, leaping and gyrating at their best. When the bride would squat the dancers would even 
increase their efforts, running a little way to the front and returning to the bride as if endeavoring to induce her to proceed. 
It did not avail, for she would hot move till she received some trinket. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2163">In crossing streams or other obstacles the bride was carried by her father-in-law; the bridegroom was carried by one of his 
attendants. Presently they <span id="d0e2165" class="pageno">page 60</span>arrived at a critical spot. This is the place where many a man has to let his wife return to her mother; for here it is the 
bride wants to see how many presents are coming to her. If satisfied, she goes on. In this case there was a shortage, and 
everybody became. excited. The husband huddled to the side of his bride and looked into her face with a very pitiful expression, 
as if pleading with her to continue. But she was firm. In a few minutes several people formed a circle and commenced dancing 
in the same way as at their religious ceremony, and chanting low and solemnly an admonition to the husband's parents and friends 
to give presents to the bride. This was repeated several times, when there came a lull. The bride was still firm in her opinion 
that the amount offered was insufficient. I had supplied myself with some cheap jewelry, and a few trinkets satisfied her 
desires; so the &#8220;music&#8221; again started. Louder it became&#8212;wilder&#8212;resounding with a thousand echoes, and as the nude bodies of 
the Negritos glided at lightning speed from the glare of one torchlight to the other, with no word uttered but a continual 
clangor of the metal gongs, one thought that here was a dance of devils. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2168">In due time we came to a place in the path that was bordered on either side by small strips of bamboo about 3 feet long with 
both points sticking in the ground, resembling croquet arches, six on either side. When the bride arrived there she squatted 
and her maids commenced to robe her in a new gown (&agrave; la Filipina) over the one she already had on. She then continued to another 
similar place and donned a new robe over those already on. This was repeated twice, when she arrived at a triumphal arch. 
There she donned a very gaudy dress consisting of red waist and blue skirt, with a large red handkerchief as a wedding veil. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2171">Rejoicing in her five complete dresses, one over the other, she passed through the arch and again squatted. Meanwhile a fire 
was built midway between the arch and a structure specially prepared for the couple. All present except those waiting on the 
groom and bride joined in a dance around the fire, chanting gleefully and keeping time with hands and feet. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2174">All at once the circle divided just in front of the arch; two persons on opposite sides joined bands overhead. The bride now 
stood up, immediately her father-in-law caught her in his arms, ran under the human arch, and deposited her gently in the 
house of his son. When the husband, from where he was squatting under the arch, saw his bride safely laid in his house his 
joy knew no bounds. With a yell he leaped up, swinging his unsheathed bolo over his head, and in a frenzy jumped over the 
fire, passed through the human arch, and with a final yell threw his arms around his wife in a long embrace. 
</p> 
</div> 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2179">The ceremony as above described contains many details which I did not meet with in Zambales, but the main feature, the sitting 
down of the bride to receive her gifts, is the same. 
</p> 
<h2 id="d0e2184">Polygamy and Divorce</h2> 
<p id="d0e2189">As might be expected among the Negritos, a man may marry as many wives as he can buy. His inability to provide the necessary 
things for her purchase argues against his ability to provide food for her. Hence it is only the well-to-do that can afford 
the luxury of more than one wife. Visually this practice is confined to the capit&aacute;n or head man of the tribe, and even he 
seldom has more than two wives, but one case was noticed in the village of Tagiltil, where one man had seven. At Cabayan the 
capit&aacute;n had two wives, a curly-haired one, and a straight-haired one, the latter the daughter of Filipinos who had taken up 
<span id="d0e2191" class="pageno">page 61</span>their abode with the Negritos. (See <a href="#d0e8416">Pl. LV</a>.) Polygamy is allowed throughout the Negrito territory. It is not uncommon for a man to marry sisters or a widow and her 
daughter. Marriage between blood relatives is prohibited. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2197">Divorce is not very common with the Negritos in Zambales. There seems to be a sentiment against it. If a man is powerful enough 
he may divorce his wife, but if he does so for any other reason than desertion or unfaithfulness her relatives are likely 
to make a personal matter of it and cause trouble. A man and his wife may separate by mutual agreement and that of their families. 
In such a case whatever property they may have is divided equally, but the mother takes the children. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2200">A more frequent occurrence than that, however, is the desertion of her husband by a woman who has found some one of greater 
attractions elsewhere, probably in another rancheria, but even these cases are rare. If it is possible to reach the offender 
the new husband will have to pay up, otherwise it is necessary for the woman's parents to pay back to the injured husband 
all that he has paid for her. But if the offender is caught and is found to be unable to pay the necessary price the penalty 
is death. In any event the husband's interests are guarded. Ile can either recover on his investment or get revenge. 
</p> 
<h2 id="d0e2204">Burial</h2> 
<p id="d0e2209">Notwithstanding the repeated statements of travelers that Negritos bury their dead under their houses, which are then abandoned, 
nothing of this kind was met in Zambales, and Mr. Cooke did not see it in Bataan. He says that in the latter province the 
body is placed in a coffin made by hollowing out a tree, and is buried in some high spot, but there is no regular burying 
ground. A rude shed and a fence are built to protect the grave. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2212">In Zambales any spot may be selected. The body is wrapped up in a mat and buried at a depth of 3 or 4 feet to protect it from 
dogs and wild boars. With their few tools such interment constitutes an arduous labor. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2215">I was unable to learn of any special ceremony performed at a burial. Montano says they have one, and Mr. Cooke states that 
all the relatives of the deceased kneel in a circle around the coffin and sing a mournful monotone. The Negritos of Zambales 
repeatedly affirmed that they had no burial ceremony. 
</p> 
<h2 id="d0e2219">Morals</h2> 
<p id="d0e2224">I believe that many of the vices of the Negrito are due to contact with the Malayan to whom be is, at least in point of truthfulness, 
honesty, and temperance, far superior. It is rare that he will tell a lie unless he thinks he will be greatly benefited by 
it, and he seems not to indulge <span id="d0e2226" class="pageno">page 62</span>in purposeless lying, as so often do his more civilized neighbors. So far as my acquaintance with him goes, I never detected 
an untruth except one arising from errors of judgment. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2229">In their dealings with each other there seldom occur disputes among the Negritos, which in itself is an evidence of their 
natural honesty. With Filipinos, they are inclined to accept and respect the opinions of their more knowing, if less honest, 
patrons, and take what is offered for their produce with little protest. It is to be feared, however, that as they realize 
the duplicity of the Filipinos they themselves may begin to, practice it 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2232">Alcoholism is unknown among them, but they drink willingly of the native drinks, &#8220;tuba&#8221; and &#8220;anisado,&#8221; whenever it is offered 
them. They do not make these beverages. Nowhere does it seem to have gotten a hold on them, and there are no drunkards. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2235">The practice of smoking is followed by Negritos of both sexes, old and young, although they are not such inveterate smokers 
as are the Filipinos. The custom prevails of smoking roughly made cigars of tobacco leaves tied up with a grass string, always 
with the lighted end in the mouth. After smoking a few whiffs, the cigar is allowed to go out, and the stump is tucked away 
in the breechcloth or behind the ear for future use. One of these stumps may be seen somewhere about a Negrito at almost any 
time. Pipes are never used. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2238">Very few Negritos chew betel nut, and their teeth, although sharpened as they are, offer a pleasing contrast to the betel-stained 
teeth of the average Filipino. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2241">While one can not speak authoritatively in regard to relation of the sexes without a long and close study of their customs, 
yet all the evidence at band goes to show that the Negritos as a race are virtuous, especially when compared with the Christianized 
natives. Their statement that death is their penalty for adultery is generally accepted as true, and probably is, with some 
modifications. Montano mentions it twice,<a id="d0e2243src" href="#d0e2243" class="noteref">3</a> and he asserts further in regard to the Negritos of Bataan that &#8220;sexual relations outside of marriage are exceedingly rare. 
A young girl suspected of it must forever renounce the hope of finding a husband.&#8221; 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2247">In Zambales the Negritos continually assert that adultery is punishable by death, but closer questioning usually brought out 
the fact that the offenders could buy off if they possessed the means. Montano makes the statement that in case of adultery 
it is the injured husband who executes the death sentence. However, the injured husband is satisfied if he recovers what he 
paid for his wife in the beginning. In case of a daughter, the father exacts the payment, and only in case he is destitute 
is it likely to go hard with the offender. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2250">It has been asserted also that theft is punishable by death. The <span id="d0e2252" class="pageno">page 63</span>Negritos say that if a man is caught stealing and can not pay the injured person whatever he considers the value of the stolen 
article and the fine that is assessed against him, he will be put to death. But, as a matter of fact, it is never done. He 
is given his time in which to pay his fine or someone else may pay it; and in the latter case the offender becomes a sort 
of slave and works for his benefactor. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2255">Murder is punishable by death. The victim is executed in the manner already described in the torture dance. But murder is 
so rare as to be almost unknown. The disposition of the Negrito is peaceable and seldom leads him into trouble. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2258">Cooke<a id="d0e2260src" href="#d0e2260" class="noteref">4</a> states that as a punishment for lighter offenses the Negritos of Bataan use an instrument, called &#8220;con-de-m&aacute;n,&#8221; which is 
simply a split stick sprung on the neck from six to twenty hours, according to the degree of the crime, and which is said 
to be very painful. Nothing like this was seen in Zambales. 
</p> 
<h2 id="d0e2265">Slavery</h2> 
<p id="d0e2270">Notwithstanding the statements of Montano that the Negritos have no slaves and know nothing of slavery, the reverse is true, 
in Zambales at least; so say the Negritos and also the Filipinos who have spent several years among them. The word &#8220;a-li&#8242;-pun&#8221; 
is used among them to express such social condition. As has been stated, a man caught stealing may become a slave, as also 
may a person captured from another rancheria, a child left without support, a person under death sentence, or a debtor. It 
was also stated that if a man committed a crime and escaped a relative could be seized as a slave. It will take a long acquaintance 
with the Negritos and an intimate knowledge of their customs to get at the truth of these statements. 
</p> 
<h2 id="d0e2274">Intellectual Life</h2> 
<p id="d0e2279">The countenance of the average Negrito is not dull and passive, as might reasonably be expected, but is fairly bright and 
keen, more so than the average Malayan countenance. The Negrito also has a look of good nature&#8212;a look usually lacking in the 
Malayan. His knowledge of things other than those pertaining to his environment is, of course, extremely limited, but he is 
possessed of an intellect that is capable of growth under proper conditions. He always manifests the most lively interest 
in things which he does not understand, and he tries to assign causes for them. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2282">Natural phenomena he is unable to explain. When the sun sets it goes down behind a precipice so far off that he could not 
walk to it, but he does not know how it gets back to the east. Rain comes from the clouds, but he does not know how it got 
there except that thunder and lightning bring it. These things are incomprehensible to him and <span id="d0e2284" class="pageno">page 64</span>he has apparently invented no stories concerning them. While thunder and lightning are good because they bring rain, yet if 
they are exceedingly violent he becomes afraid and tries to stop them by burning deer's bones, which, he says, are always 
efficacious. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2287">The mathematical knowledge of the Negritos is naturally small. They count on their fingers and toes, beginning always with 
the thumb and great toe. If the things they are counting are more than twenty they go through the process again, but never 
repeat the fingers without first counting the toes. To add they use rice or small stones. They have no weights or measures 
except those of the civilized natives, but usually compare things to be measured with some known object. Distance is estimated 
by the time taken to walk it, but they have no conception of hours. It may take from sunrise until the sun is directly overhead 
to go from a certain rancheria to another, but if asked the number of hours the Negrito is as likely to say three or eight 
as six. They have no division of time by weeks or months, but have periods corresponding to the phase of the moon, to which 
they give names. The new moon is called &#8220;bay&#8242;-un bu&#8242;-an,&#8221; the full moon &#8220;da-a&#8242;-na bu&#8242;-an,&#8221; and the waning moon &#8220;may-a&#8242;-mo-a 
bu&#8242;-an.&#8221; They determine years by the planting or harvesting season. Yet no record of years is kept, and memory seldom goes 
back beyond the last season. Hence the Negritos have no idea. of age. They know that they are old enough to have children 
or grandchildren, and that is as far as their knowledge of age goes. To count days ahead they tie knots in a string of bejuco 
and each day cut off one knot. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2290">In regard to units of value they are familiar with the peso and other coins of the Philippines and have vague ideas as to 
their value. But one meets persistently the word &#8220;tael&#8221; in their estimate of the value of things. A tael is 5 pesos. If asked 
how much he paid for his wife a mail may say &#8220;luampo fact.&#8221; Where they got this Chinese term I do not attempt to say, unless 
it points to very remote commercial relations with the Chinese, a thine, which seems incredible.<a id="d0e2292src" href="#d0e2292" class="noteref">5</a> 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2296">The Negritos have developed to a high degree a sense of the dramatic, and they can relate a tale graphically, becoming so 
interested in their account as to seem to for get their surroundings. For instance, a head man was giving me one night an 
account of their marriage ceremony. He went through all the motions necessary to depict various actions, talking faster and 
louder as if warming up to his theme, his eyes sparkling and his face and manner eager. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2299">They are much like children in their curiosity to see the white man's belongings, and are as greatly pleased with the gift 
of a trinket. Their expressions and actions on beholding themselves in a mirror for the <span id="d0e2301" class="pageno">page 65</span>first time are extremely ludicrous. One man who had a goatee gazed at it and stroked it with feelings of pride and admiration 
not unmixed with awe. 
</p> 
<h3 id="d0e2304">Superstitions</h3> 
<p id="d0e2309">It will also take a close acquaintance to learn much of the superstitious beliefs of the Negritos. Some hints have already 
been given in regard to feeding the spirits after a hunt and reasons for changing names of children. Other superstitious were 
mentioned, as the wearing of bracelets and leglets of wild boar's skin and the burning of deer's bones to scare away thunder. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2312">The basis of all the superstitious beliefs of the Negritos, what might else be termed their religion, is the constant presence 
of the spirits of the dead near where they lived when alive. All places are inhabited by the spirits. All adverse circumstances, 
sickness, failure of crops, unsuccessful hunts, are attributed to them. So long as things go well the spirits are not so much 
considered. There seems to be no particular worship or offerings to gain the good will of the spirits, other than the feeding 
already noted, except in one particular. On the Tarlac trail between O'Donnell (Tarlac Province) and Botolan (Zambales Province) 
there is a huge black bowlder which the Negritos believe to be the home of one powerful spirit. So far as I could learn, the 
belief is that the spirits of all who die enter this one spirit or &#8220;anito&#8221; who has its abiding place in this rock. However 
that may be, no Negrito, and in fact no Christianized native of Zambales or Tarlac, ever passes this rock without leaving 
a banana, camote, or some other article of food. If they do, bad luck or accident is sure to attend the trip. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2315">Se&ntilde;or Potenciano Lesaca, the present governor of Zambales, when quite young, once passed the rock and for amusement&#8212;and greatly 
to the horror of the Negritos with him-spurned it by kicking it with his foot and eating part of a banana and throwing the 
rest in the opposite direction. The Negritos were much concerned and said that something would happen to him. Sure enough, 
before he had gone far he got an arrow through both legs from savage Negritos along the trail who could have known nothing 
of the occurrence. Of course this only strengthened the belief. There is nothing unusual about the shape of the stone. It 
is merely a large, round bowlder. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2318">Disease is usually considered a punishment for wrongdoing, the more serious diseases coming from the supreme anito, the lesser 
ones from the lesser anitos. If smallpox visits a rancheria it is because someone has cut down a tree or killed an animal 
belonging to a spirit which has invoked the aid of the supreme spirit in inflicting a more severe punishment than it can do 
alone. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2321">For the lesser diseases there are mediquillos or medicine men or women, <span id="d0e2323" class="pageno">page 66</span>called &#8220;ma&ntilde;ga-anito,&#8221; who are called to exorcise the spirit creating the disturbance. Anyone who has cured patients or belongs 
to a family of mediquillos can follow the profession. There is an aversion to being a mediquillo, although it pays, because 
if a patient dies the medicine man who treated him is held accountable. As a rule they are treated with respect, and people 
stand more or less in awe of them, but they have sometimes been killed when they failed to effect a cure. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2326">Se&ntilde;or Benito Guido, a native of Botolan, who accompanied me to the barrio of Tagiltil as interpreter, became slightly ill 
while in a camp. The Negritos were much worked up over it. They said it was caused by cutting the bamboo for our camp, the 
spirits that owned the bamboo being offended. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2329">In order that we might witness their customs in such cases, an old woman who practiced as &#8220;ma&ntilde;ga-anito&#8221; was called and offered 
to relieve the patient for a little money. A peso was given her and she began. Upon being asked how he was affected Se&ntilde;or 
Guido said that he felt as if something was weighing him down. Of course this was the spirit, which had to be removed before 
a cure could be effected. The Ma&ntilde;ga-anito danced around the patient and bad him dance and turn somersaults. This was to make 
the spirit sorry he had chosen such an unstable abiding place. Finally she took hold of his hands, gave a mighty tug and then 
dropped back stiff. The spirit had passed from the body of the patient into her body. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2332">During all these gymnastics the other Negritos had preserved a most solemn mien, but at this juncture they set to work to 
restore the stricken woman, rubbing and working her arms and legs until the spirit was gone. All disease is caused by spirits, 
which must be expelled from the body before a cure can be effected. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2335">Use is also made of other remedies to supplement the ministrations of the ma&ntilde;ga-anito. Attention has been called to the string 
of dried berries, called &#8220;a-gata,&#8221; which the Negritos of Pinatubo wear around their necks for convenience in case of pains 
in the stomach. In southern Zambales what seem to be these same berries are used as a charm against snake bite. Here for pains 
in the stomach they boil a piece of iron in water and drink the water hot. Pieces of certain woods are believed efficacious 
for rheumatism, and old men especially may often be seen with them tied around the limbs. This superstition is not far removed 
from the belief entertained in certain rural districts of the United States that rheumatism may be prevented by carrying a 
horse chestnut in the pocket. The Negritos also wear such pieces of wood around the neck for colds and sore throat. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2338">In cases of fever a bed is made from the leaves of a plant called &#8220;sam&#8242;-bon,&#8221; which much resembles mint, and leaves are bound 
to the affected parts. The action of these leaves is cooling. For fractures they use bamboo splints and leaves of a plant 
called &#8220;ta-cum&#8242;-ba-o.&#8221; 
<span id="d0e2340" class="pageno">page 67</span> 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2343">A bad cut is also bound up in these leaves or with the sap of a tree called &#8220;pan-da-ko&#8242;-kis.&#8221; 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2346">The Negritos do nothing for skin disease, a form of herpes, with which a great many are afflicted. They probably do not regard 
it as a disease. (See Pls. <a href="#d0e8425">LVI</a> et seq.) In case of centipede bites, if on a finger, the affected member is thrust in the anus of a chicken, where, the Negrito 
affirms, the poison is absorbed, resulting in the death of the chicken. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2352">Goiter is quite common. It is said to be caused by strain from carrying a heavy load of camotes or other objects on the head. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2355">Smallpox, as has been said, is believed to be a visitation of the wrath of the supreme spirit, and if it breaks out in a rancheria 
the victim is left with a supply of food and water and the place is abandoned. After several days have elapsed the people 
return cautiously, and if they find the patient is dead they go away again never to return, but if he has recovered they take 
up their abode in the rancheria. A great many of the Negritos seen in Zambales have scars of smallpox. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2358">The practice of blistering the body in case of sickness is very common in the Pinatubo region. The belief prevails with some 
individuals that in the healing up of the sore thus produced the sickness with which the body is afflicted will go away. Others 
affirmed that blistering was done only in case of fevers, and that the pain inflicted caused the patient to break out in a 
profuse perspiration which relieved the fever. This seems a more rational belief. Individuals were seen with as many as twenty 
scars produced in this manner. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2361">Aside from the anito belief, the Negritos have other superstitions. Cries of birds at night are especially unlucky. If a person 
is starting out on a journey and someone sneezes just as he is leaving he will not go then. It is regarded as a sign of disaster, 
and delay of an hour or so is necessary in order to allow the spell to work off. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2364">A certain parasitic plant that much resembles Yellow moss and grows high up in trees is regarded as a very powerful charm. 
It is called &#8220;gay-u-ma&#8221; and a man who possesses it is called &#8220;nanara gayuma.&#8221; If his eyes rest on a person during the new 
moon he will become sick at the stomach, but he can cure the sickness by laying hands on the afflicted part. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2367">Se&ntilde;or Benito Guido says that when a young man he was told by Negritos that this charm would float upstream. Arid when he offered 
to give a carabao for it if that were so, its power was not shown. In spite of this, however, the Negritos are firm believers 
in it, and, for that matter, so also are the Christianized Zambal and Tagalog. It is likewise thought to be of value in attracting 
women. If it is rubbed on a woman or is smoked and the smoke blows on her the conquest is complete.

<h2 id="d0e2375" class="abovehead">Chapter 7</h2> 
<h1>Spanish Attempts to Organize Negritos</h1> 
<p id="d0e2380">The attention of the Spanish Government was early attracted to the Negritos and other savages in the Philippines, and their 
subjection and conversion was the subject of many royal orders, though unfortunately little was accomplished. One of the first 
decrees of the Gobierno Superior relating especially to the Negritos was that of June 12, 1846. It runs substantially as follows: 
<div class="blockquote"> 
<p id="d0e2384">In my visits to the provinces of these Islands, having noticed, with the sympathy that they must inspire in all sensitive 
souls, the kind of life and the privations that many of the infidel tribes, and especially the Negritos who inhabit the mountains, 
are forced to endure; and persuaded that it is a duty of all civilized Governments and of humanity itself to better the condition 
of men, who, hidden thus from society, will in time become extinct, victims of their customs, of the unhealthfulness of the 
rugged places where they live, and of our negligence in helping them; and desirous of making them useful, that some day, influenced 
by the benefits of social life, they may enter the consoling pale of our Holy Mother, the Catholic Church, I hereby decree 
the following: 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2387">ARTICLE 1. The alcaldes and military and political governors of provinces in whose district there may be tribes or rancherias 
of the aforesaid Negritos or of other infidels shall proceed with the consent of the devoted curas parrocos, whose charity 
I implore for them, through their head men or capitanes, to induce them to take the necessary steps to assemble in villages, 
lands being given for that purpose, in places not very near to Christian pueblos, and seeds of grains and vegetables being 
furnished that they may cultivate the land. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2390">* * * * * * * 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2393">ART. 3. Two years after the pueblo shall have been formed the inhabitants thereof shall pay a moderate tribute, which shall 
not for the present exceed one real per head, the youths and children being excepted, obtaining in compensation the usufruct 
of the lands which they may hold as their own property so long as they do not abandon the cultivation, being able to sell

<p id="d0e2396">ART. 4. Said authorities and also the priests shall maintain the greatest zeal and vigilance that the Christian pueblos do 
not intrude on those of the infidels or Negritos, neither that individuals live among them nor that they harass or molest 
them on any pretext whatsoever under penalty of being punished. * * * 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2399">ART. 5. As I have understood that if the Negritos refuse social life it is on account of their being warned by the Christians 
who employ them in cutting wood, bamboo, and bejuco, and in the collection of other products of the woods <span id="d0e2401" class="pageno">page 69</span>which they inhabit, the chiefs of the provinces and the justices of the peace shall take care that no one enters into such 
contracts with the Negritos without competent authorization, leaving his name in a register in order that if he fail to pay 
the true value of the articles satisfactory to the Negritos or mistreats them it will be possible to fix the blame on him 
and to impose the proper penalty.

<p id="d0e2410">It shall not be necessary for the Negritos to embrace the Catholic faith, but the priests shall go among them to examine their

</p> 
</div> 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2415">Article 7 provides for a report every three months from those officers in charge of such districts. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2418">This all sounds very well, and if carried out might have succeeded in improving the condition of the unfortunate Negritos, 
but we can not find that the provincial officials showed great zeal in complying with the executive request. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2421">On January 14, 1881, a decree very similar to this was issued. The first part of this decree related to the newly converted 
or &#8220;sometidos.&#8221; But article 7 authorized the provincial authorities to offer in the name of the State to Aetas and other pagans 
the following advantages in exchange for voluntary submission: Life in pueblos; unity of families; concession of good lands 
and direction in cultivating them in the manner which they wished and which would be most productive; maintenance and clothing 
during one year; respect for their usages and customs so far as they did not oppose the natural law; to leave to their own 
wishes whether or not they should become Christians; to buy or facilitate the sale of their crops; exemption from contributions 
and tributes for ten years and lastly, government by local officials elected by themselves under the direct dependency of 
the head of the province or district. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2424">These provisions were certainly liberal enough, but they bore little fruit so far as the Negritos were concerned. Being sent 
out as circulars to the chiefs of all provinces, such decrees received scant attention, each provincial head probably preferring 
to believe that they were meant for someone else. Although it sounded well on paper, the difficulties in the way of successful 
compliance with such an order were many. But in one way and another the authorities sought to reach the hill tribes, though 
it must be confessed they were actuated rather by a desire to preserve peace in their provinces and to protect the plainsmen 
from the plundering raids of the savages than by motives of philanthropy in improving the condition of the latter. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2427">The Negritos of Zambales were classed as conquistados and non-conquistados, according to whether they lived in amicable relations 
with the Filipinos or stole carabaos and killed the people whenever they had the opportunity. The Guardia Civil made many 
raids into the mountains for the purpose of punishing the predatory Negritos, and many <span id="d0e2429" class="pageno">page 70</span>are the stories related by old members of that military organization now living in the province concerning conflicts which 
they had with the little black bow-and-arrow men, who always got the worst of it. Gradually they came to see the futility 
of resistance. As a matter of fact these raids were only for the purpose of securing food and not because of enmity toward 
the Filipinos. When a group expressed their desire to live peaceably in their hills they were dubbed &#8220;conquistados&#8221; and left 
alone so long as they behaved. The number of conquistados grew and the &#8220;unconquered&#8221; retreated farther into the mountains. 
Carabao raids are very infrequent now, for the people disposed to make them are too remote from the plains and would have 
to pass through territory of the settled and peaceable Negritos, who would inform the party sent in pursuit. But the Constabulary 
has had two or three raids of this kind to deal with during the past two years. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2432">Those Negritos still living in a wild state have very simple government. They simply gather around the most powerful man, 
whom they recognize as a sort of chief and whom they follow into raids oil the plains or neighboring tribes of Negritos. But 
when living peaceably scattered through their mountains each head of a family is a small autocrat and rules his family and 
those of his sons who elect to remain with him. When he dies the oldest son becomes the head of the family. Usually, however, 
a group of families living in one locality recognizes one man as a capit&aacute;n. He may be chosen by the president of the nearest 
pueblo or by the Negritos themselves, who are quick to recognize in this way superior ability or greater wealth. The capit&aacute;n 
settles disputes between families. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2435">The next step in the civilizing process is the gathering together to form villages. This was the end to which the Spaniards 
worked, but the process was retarded by the Christianized natives who profited by trade with the Negritos in forest products 
and who advised them to avoid coming under Spanish rule where they would have to pay tribute. If a community became sufficiently 
large and bade fair to be permanent it was made a barrio of the nearest pueblo and given a teniente and concejales like other 
barrios. This was the case with Aglao and Santa F&eacute;, in the jurisdiction of San Marcelino, but Ilokano immigrants settled in 
these places and the Negritos gradually withdrew to the hills and settled in other places, until now there are very few Negritos 
actually living in these towns. One old man in Aglao, who once went to Spain as a servant to an officer, speaks very good 
Spanish. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2438">In spite of the reprisals made by the Guardia Civil and other means employed by the Spaniards, Negrito raids went on without 
much cessation until 1894. In that year the authorities induced a head man named Layos to come down to the town of San Marcelino 
for an interview. Layos came down about as nature had provided him and was <span id="d0e2440" class="pageno">page 71</span>received with much ceremony by the town authorities. They dressed him up from head to foot, made him presents, and feasted 
him for several days. Then with the customary Spanish pomp, parade of soldiery, and flare of trumpets, they presented him 
with a gaudy sash and named him Capit&aacute;n General del Monte. He was given charge of all the Negritos in the district and charged 
to keep them under control. The sash was a cheap print affair, but it answered the purpose. The effect of all this on an untamed 
savage can be imagined. Layos was impressed. He went back to the hills with his new treasures and an experience worth relating. 
It is said that the robbing and killing of Christian natives lessened materially after that. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2443">When I was at Cabayan in that district I saw Layos. He was a heavy-set man of about 38, harelipped, an old ragged shirt and 
breechcloth his only apparel, and with nothing of his former grandeur but the memory. The sash, his badge of office, he said 
had long since gone in breechcloths. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2446">In the same year (1894) all Negritos in the Botolan district who would come down from the mountains were fed for five or six 
months in hope that they would settle down and remain. But they were given nothing to do and were not shown how to work, and 
when the feeding stopped they all went back to the hills, the only place where they knew how to secure sustenance. Although 
this experiment did not result as desired, it probably had good effects, for the people of this region are the farthest advanced 
to-day and are most inclined to live in villages. I am informed that since my visit some of the Negritos have moved down to 
the Filipino village of Pombato and there are several Negrito children in the native school. The people of Tagiltil have even 
expressed a desire for a school. The presence of several Zambal and halfbreeds in this village and its nearness to the Filipinos 
probably account for its being ahead of other villages in this as in other respects.

<h1 id="d0e2452">Anthropometric Measurements</h1> 
<p id="d0e2457">The paucity of measurements has already been explained, but those that were taken are given here for what they are worth. 
I do not attempt to draw any conclusions from them or undertake any discussion other than that already given in the chapter 
on physical features. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e2460">In the following tables it should be noted that where the age is given the number indicates only an estimate, as no Negrito 
knows his age. It has been thought better to give these approximate ages than to leave them out entirely, in order to distinguish 
the very young from the middle aged and old:

<h1 id="d0e5343">Vocabularies</h1> 
<p id="d0e5348">As has been pointed out already, the Negritos of Zambales seem to have lost entirely their own language and to have adopted 
that of the Christianized Zambal. A study of the vocabularies here given will show that in various sections of the province 
Zambal is to-day the language of the Negritos. Differences will be found, of course, in the dialects of regions which do not 
come much into contact with each other, and contact with other dialects creates different changes in different localities. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e5351">The chief difference between the Bolinao dialect and that of the region south is the substitution of the letter &#8220;r&#8221; in the 
former for &#8220;l;&#8221; as &#8220;arong&#8221; for &#8220;along,&#8221; nose; &#8220;dira&#8221; for &#8220;dila,&#8221; tongue. Yet not a few words are entirely different. These 
differences may arise from the use of synonyms or from misinformation, as I was able to take the Bolinao vocabulary from only 
two individuals. This dialect is spoken in the towns of Bolinao, Anda, Bani, and Zaragoza, although I am informed that there 
are even slight differences in the speech of the people of some of these towns. The towns from Infanta to Iba have the second 
dialect. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e5354">When the Aeta element enters the differences become more apparent, although the relationship between the differing words may 
often be seen; for instance, &#8220;sabot,&#8221; hair, becomes &#8220;habot;&#8221; &#8220;along,&#8221; nose, becomes &#8220;balongo.&#8221; But the number of words which 
bear no relationship is greater than in the case of the first two dialects. It is possible that here we find traces of an 
original Negrito language, but I believe that all these words can be traced to Malay roots. It will be noticed also that the 
two following vocabularies taken from Negritos at Santa F&eacute; and Subig do not differ materially from the Zambal-Aeta&#8212;in fact, 
they may be regarded as identical. 
</p> 
<p id="d0e5357">The writer can not vouch for the vocabularies from Bataan and Bulacan, but gives them for the sake of comparison. The words 
collected by Montano are mostly Tagalog and differ somewhat from Cooke's. The latter states that he verified his seven times. 
The two sets are probably from different parts of the province. The Dumagat vocabulary from Bulacan Province, while offering 
greater differences, is plainly of Malay origin like all the others.
