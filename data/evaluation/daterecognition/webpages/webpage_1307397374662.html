by: Ellen Hodgson Brown J.D.</em>, <a href="http://www.truth-out.org/the-egyptian-tinderbox-how-banks-and-investors-are-starving-third-world67424"> t r u t h o u t | News Analysis</a></p>
<p><em>&#8220;What for a poor man is a crust, for a rich man is a securitized asset class.&#8221; -Futures trader Ann Berg, quoted in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2011/jan/23/food-speculation-banks-hunger-poverty" target="_blank">The Guardian UK</a>.</em></p>
<p>Underlying the sudden, volatile uprising in Egypt and  Tunisia is a growing global crisis sparked by soaring food prices and  unemployment. The Associated Press <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110127/ap_on_bi_ge/ml_egypt_protests_economy" target="_blank">reports</a> that roughly 40 percent of Egyptians struggle along at the World  Bank-set poverty level of under $2 per day. Analysts estimate that food  price inflation in Egypt is currently at an unsustainable 17 percent  yearly. In poorer countries, as much as <a href="http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2008/1000826/index.html" target="_blank">60 to 80 percent</a> of people&#8217;s incomes go for food, compared to just 10 to 20 percent in  industrial countries. An increase of a dollar or so in the cost of a  gallon of milk or a loaf of bread for Americans can mean starvation for  people in Egypt and other poor countries.</p>
<p><strong>Follow the Money</strong></p>
<p>The cause of the recent jump in global food prices  remains a matter of debate. Some analysts blame the Federal Reserve&#8217;s  &#8220;quantitative easing&#8221; program (increasing the money supply with credit  created with accounting entries), which they warn is sparking  hyperinflation. Too much money chasing too few goods is the classic  explanation for rising prices.</p>
<p>The problem with that theory is that the global money supply has actually <a href="http://www.minyanville.com/businessmarkets/articles/bank-funding-european-banks-ecb-european/1/20/2011/id/32284" target="_blank">shrunk</a> since 2006, when food prices began their dramatic rise. Virtually all  money today is created on the books of banks as &#8220;credit&#8221; or &#8220;debt,&#8221; and  overall lending has shrunk. This has occurred in an accelerating process  of <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110124006336/en/Deflation-2011-Beyond%C2%A0as-Financial-Deleveraging-Persists-Gary" target="_blank">deleveraging</a> (paying down or writing off loans and not making new ones), as the  subprime housing market has collapsed and bank capital requirements have  been raised. Although it seems counterintuitive, the more debt there  is, the more money there is in the system. As debt shrinks, the money  supply shrinks in tandem.</p>
<p>That is why government debt today is not actually the  bugaboo it is being made out to be by the deficit terrorists. The  flipside of debt is credit, and businesses run on it. When credit  collapses, <a href="http://www.international-economy.com/TIE_Sp09_WorldTrade.pdf" target="_blank">trade collapses</a>.  When private debt shrinks, public debt must therefore step in to  replace it. The &#8220;good&#8221; credit or debt is the kind used for building  infrastructure and other productive capacity, increasing the Gross  Domestic Product (GDP) and wages; and this is the kind governments are  in a position to employ. The parasitic forms of credit or debt are the  gamblers&#8217; money-making-money schemes, which add nothing to GDP.</p>
<p>Prices <em>have</em> been driven up by too much money  chasing too few goods, but the money is chasing only certain selected  goods. Food and fuel prices are up, but housing prices are down. The net  result is that overall price inflation remains low.</p>
<p>While quantitative easing may not be the culprit, Fed  action has driven the rush into commodities. In response to the banking  crisis of 2008, the Federal Reserve dropped the Fed funds rate (the  rate at which banks borrow from each other) nearly to zero. This has  allowed banks and their customers to borrow in the US at very low rates  and invest abroad for higher returns, creating a dollar &#8220;carry trade.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, interest rates on federal securities were  also driven to very low levels, leaving investors without that safe,  stable option for funding their retirements. &#8220;Hot money&#8221; &#8211; investment  seeking higher returns &#8211; fled from the collapsed housing market into <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/245574-who-s-to-blame-for-high-commodity-prices-it-s-the-producers-stupid" target="_blank">anything but the dollar</a>, which generally meant fleeing into commodities.</p>
<p><strong>New Meaning to the Old Adage &#8220;Don&#8217;t Play With Your Food&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>At one time food was considered a poor speculative  investment, because it was too perishable to be stored until market  conditions were right for resale. But that changed with the development  of ETFs (exchange-traded funds) and other financial innovations.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.truth-out.org/newsletter" target="_blank">Let Truthout send our best stories to your inbox every day, for free. </a></em></p>
<p>As first devised, speculation in food futures was  fairly innocuous, since when the contract expired, somebody actually had  to buy the product at the &#8220;spot&#8221; or cash price. This forced the  fanciful futures price and the more realistic spot price into alignment.  But that changed in 1991. In a revealing July 2010 report in Harper&#8217;s  Magazine titled &#8220;The Food Bubble: How Wall Street Starved Millions and  Got Away with It,&#8221; Frederick Kaufman wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>The history of food took an ominous turn in 1991, at a  time when no one was paying much attention. That was the year Goldman  Sachs decided our daily bread might make an excellent investment&#8230;.</p>
<p>Robber barons, gold bugs, and financiers of every  stripe had long dreamed of controlling all of something everybody needed  or desired, then holding back the supply as demand drove up prices.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Kaufman explained this financial innovation in a July 16 <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2010/7/16/the_food_bubble_how_wall_street" target="_blank">interview</a> on Democracy Now:</p>
<blockquote><p>Goldman &#8230; came up with this idea of the commodity  index fund, which really was a way for them to accumulate huge piles of  cash for themselves&#8230;. Instead of a buy-and-sell order, like everybody  does in these markets, they just started buying. It&#8217;s called &#8220;going  long.&#8221; They started going long on wheat futures&#8230;. And every time one  of these contracts came due, they would do something called &#8220;rolling it  over&#8221; into the next contract&#8230;. And they kept on buying and buying and  buying and buying and accumulating this historically unprecedented pile  of long-only wheat futures. And this accumulation created a very odd  phenomenon in the market. It&#8217;s called a &#8220;demand shock.&#8221; Usually prices  go up because supply is low&#8230;. In this case, Goldman and the other  banks had introduced this completely unnatural and artificial demand to  buy wheat, and that then set the price up&#8230;. [H]ard red wheat generally  trades between $3 and $6 per sixty-pound bushel. It went up to $12,  then $15, then $18. Then it broke $20. And on February 25th, 2008, hard  red spring futures settled at $25 per bushel&#8230;. [T]he irony here is  that in 2008, it was the greatest wheat-producing year in world history.</p>
<p>&#8230; [T]he other outrage &#8230; is that at the time that Goldman and these  other banks are completely messing up the structure of this market,  they&#8217;ve protected themselves outside the market, through this really  almost diabolical idea called &#8220;replication&#8221;&#8230;. Let&#8217;s say, &#8230; you want  me to invest for you in the wheat market. You give me a hundred  bucks&#8230;. [W]hat I should be doing is putting a hundred bucks in the  wheat markets. But I don&#8217;t have to do that. All I have to do is put $5  in&#8230;. And with that $5, I can hold your hundred-dollar position. Well,  now I&#8217;ve got ninety-five of your dollars&#8230;. [W]hat Goldman did with  hundreds of billions of dollars, and what all these banks did with  hundreds of billions of dollars, is they put them in the most  conservative investments conceivable. They put it in T-bills&#8230;. [N]ow  that you have hundreds of billions of dollars in T-bills, you can  leverage that into trillions of dollars&#8230;. And then they take that  trillion dollars, they give it to their day traders, and they say, &#8220;Go  at it, guys. Do whatever is most lucrative today.&#8221; And so, as billions  of people starve, they use that money to make billions of dollars for  themselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other researchers have concurred in this explanation  of the food crisis. In a July 2010 article called &#8220;How Goldman Sachs  Gambled on Starving the World&#8217;s Poor &#8211; And Won,&#8221; journalist Johann Hari <a href="http://johannhari.com/2010/07/02/how-goldman-sachs-gambling-on-starving-the-worlds-poor-and-won" target="_blank">observed</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Beginning in late 2006, world food prices began  rising. A year later, wheat price had gone up 80 percent, maize by 90  percent and rice by 320 percent. Food riots broke out in more than 30  countries, and 200 million people faced malnutrition and starvation.  Suddenly, in the spring of 2008, food prices fell to previous levels, as  if by magic. Jean Ziegler, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to  Food, has called this &#8220;a silent mass murder,&#8221; entirely due to &#8220;man-made  actions.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Some economists said the hikes were caused by  increased demand by Chinese and Indian middle-class population booms and  the growing use of corn for ethanol. But according to Professor Jayati  Ghosh of the Centre for Economic Studies in New Delhi, demand from those  countries actually <em>fell</em> by 3 percent over the period; and the International Grain Council stated that global production of wheat had <em>increased</em> during the price spike.</p>
<p>According to a study by the now-defunct Lehman  Brothers, index fund speculation jumped from $13 billion to $260 billion  from 2003 to 2008. Not surprisingly, food prices rose in tandem,  beginning in 2003. Hedge fund manager Michael Masters estimated that on  the regulated exchanges in the US, 64 percent of all wheat contracts  were held by speculators with no interest whatever in real wheat. They  owned it solely in anticipation of price inflation and resale. George  Soros said it was &#8220;just like secretly hoarding food during a hunger  crisis in order to make profits from increasing prices.&#8221;</p>
<p>An August 2009 paper by <a href="http://www.networkideas.org/working/dec2009/08_2009.pdf" target="_blank">Jayati Ghosh</a>,  professor at the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning at Jawaharlal  Nehru University in New Delhi, compared food staples traded on futures  markets with staples that were not. She found that the price of food  staples not traded on futures markets, such as millet, cassava and  potatoes, rose only a fraction as much as staples subject to  speculation, such as wheat.</p>
<p><a href="http://motherjones.com/politics/2008/06/who-benefits-high-food-prices" target="_blank">Nomi Prins</a>,  writing in Mother Jones in 2008, also blamed the price hikes on  speculation. She observed that agricultural futures and energy futures  were being packaged and sold just like CDOs (collateralized debt  obligations), but in this case they were called CCOs (collateralized  commodity obligations). The higher the price of food, the more CCO  investors profited. She warned:</p>
<blockquote><p>[W]ithout strong regulation of electronic exchanges  and the derivatives products that enable speculators to move huge  proportions of the futures markets underlying commodities, putting a bit  of regulation into the London-based exchanges will not alleviate  anything. Unless that&#8217;s addressed, this bubble is going to take more  than homes with it. It&#8217;s going to take lives.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What Can Be Done?</strong></p>
<p>According to Kaufman, the food bubble has now  increased the ranks of the world&#8217;s hungry by 250 million. On July 21,  2010, President Obama signed a Wall Street reform bill that would close  many of the regulatory loopholes allowing big financial institutions to  play in agriculture commodity futures markets, but Kaufman says the  bill&#8217;s solutions are not likely to work. Wall Street innovators can  devise new ways to speculate that easily dance around cumbersome,  slow-to-pass legislation. Attempts to ban all food speculation are also  unlikely to work, he says, since firms can pick up the phone and do  their trades through London, or arrange over-the-counter (private)  swaps.</p>
<p>As an alternative, Kaufman suggests a worldwide or  national grain reserve, so that regulators can bring wheat into the  market when needed to stabilize prices. He notes that we actually kept a  large grain reserve in the Clinton era, before the mania for  deregulation. President Franklin Roosevelt pledged to maintain a large  grain reserve in his second Agricultural Adjustment Act in 1938.</p>
<p>Chris Cook, former director of a global energy exchange, maintains:</p>
<blockquote><p>The only long term solution is to completely  re-architect markets. Firstly, cutting out middlemen &#8211; which is a  process already under way. Secondly, a new settlement between producer  and consumer nations &#8211; a Bretton Woods II.</p></blockquote>
<p>Speculative markets today are driven more by fear,  says Cook, than by greed. Investors are looking for something safe that  will give them an adequate return, which means something they can live  on in retirement. They need these investments because their employers  and the government do not provide an adequate safety net.</p>
<p>At one time, federal securities were a safe and  adequate investment for retirees. Then federal interest rates plunged,  and investors moved into municipal bonds. Now that market, too, is  collapsing, due to threats of bankruptcy among bond issuers. Cities,  counties and states floundering from the credit crisis have been denied  access to the quantitative easing tools used to bail out the banks &#8211;  although it was the banks, not local governments, that caused the  crisis. See &#8220;<a href="http://www.webofdebt.com/articles/nobailout_mainstreet.php" target="_blank">The Fed Has Spoken: No Bailout for Main Street</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, pensions are being slashed and Social  Security is under attack. Arguably, along with the grain reserves  institutionalized under Franklin Roosevelt, we need an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Bill_of_Rights" target="_blank">Economic Bill of Rights</a> of the sort he envisioned, one that would guarantee citizens at least a  bare minimum standard of living. This could be done through job  guarantees when people were able to work and Social Security when they  were not. The program could be funded with government-created credit or  government-bank-created credit, and this could be done without causing  hyperinflation. To support that contention would take more space than is  left here, but the subject has been tackled in my book &#8220;<a href="http://www.webofdebt.com/" target="_blank">Web of Debt</a>.&#8221;  In the meantime, the credit needed to get local economies up and  running again can be furnished through publicly-owned banks.

					<p style="text-align: justify;">The greatest transfer of wealth in history is old news &#8211; but now that baby Boomer recipients are beginning to retire, on the heels of the meltdown, how will this affect the industry?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Changing client investment parameters are leaving some firms scrambling to adapt. The aftershocks of the Financial crisis are reverberating in portfolio allocation, and sweeping changes may result for the industry, from a service provider perspective (and then of course there will be regulatory reform, but that&#8217;s another horse entirely) . With more than a trillion dollars lost by those about to retire, many would be retirees are reportedly allocating an increasing portion of assets out of growth oriented products like equities, an into income producing products and managed accounts, according to a recent report released by consulting firm Deloitte LLP. <a href="http://www.brokerdealermagazine.com/?p=830#more-830" class="more-link">(more&#8230;)</a></p>

					<p>Small brokers are reporting marked gains in client share as well higher quality Brokers. This comes as a surprise to many in financial services, since bailouts and government loans have bolstered the positions of the Big Firms.</p>
<p>Ironically, it may be the very fact of government intervention &#8211; combined with the failures at virtually all big firms &#8211; that has contributed to the trend. <a href="http://www.brokerdealermagazine.com/?p=826#more-826" class="more-link">(more&#8230;)</a></p>

					<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How to evaluate a recruiter</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">by Chris Herbst  www.JupiterConsultantsLLC.com</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In these tough times, Advisors are increasingly turning toward professional help in job seeking. In this market, some are just happy to locate a firm that doesn&#8217;t have a hiring freeze. But there is light at the end of the tunnel, as firms seem to have begun hiring again &#8211; and some of thelarger firms are reputed to be offering signing bonused, although these are most often structured as retention bonuses. Be that as it may, the market is shedding the summer doldrums and jobs are being offered. And good recruiters can be a great help. But therein lies the problem; recruiters can be very expensive to hire, and costlier still if they don&#8217;t know what they are doing or are out of touch with the latest trends.</p>
<p>Evaluating recruiters is a difficult task in and of itself. One may find recruiters promising pay jumps of 250%, maybe even 300%. Others promise little. Some recruiters enjoy near celebrity status from prolific writings, while others maintain a stealth approach. So how does one evaluate a recruiter? <a href="http://www.brokerdealermagazine.com/?p=822#more-822" class="more-link">(more&#8230;)</a></p>

					<p><img src="http://www.brokerdealermagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/shutterstock_7991431.gif" align="left" />Due to the heightened terror alerts, the constant and significant drain on our nation’s financial and human resources represented by dual wars, the lingering and continuously dire aftermath in the credit markets, and the severely beaten US dollar, the landscape by which we make our recommendations has changed rather significantly in the last year. Are bonds a place for cowboys or for cowards? <a href="http://www.brokerdealermagazine.com/?p=285#more-285" class="more-link">(more&#8230;)</a></p>

					<p align="justify">Whether you decide to launch your own brokerage firm or simply leave the wirehouse environment, you have a decision to make: Open a small office as an independent contractor with an indy B/D, or become an RIA? The first question to ask yourself is, do I really want to be a business owner?  The reason being is now, in either case, you will have your practice to manage and a business to run.Many wirehouse reps don’t have the “burning desire” needed to become a real entrepreneur and business owner some industry observers say, because in the end they truly appreciate the comfort and prestige of a large firm. But many younger reps or those in the earlier stages of their careers are more willing to take the risk than many veterans who have a lot at stake, i.e., leaving hundreds of thousand of dollars in deferred comp on the table (retirement and bonus plans), and clients in proprietary products. <a href="http://www.brokerdealermagazine.com/?p=102#more-102" class="more-link">(more&#8230;)</a></p>

<p>At the start of 2005, I wrote about how painful and burdensome the regulatory process had become, and how I and the approximately 80 percent of broker dealers who are considered by the NASD to be “small” broker dealers were wishing fervently that it wasn’t so&#8230; and were looking forward to some sort of easing or consolidation of the compliance function. <a href="http://www.brokerdealermagazine.com/?p=60#more-60" class="more-link">(more&#8230;)</a></p>
