Hadith Qudsi are the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad (Peace and Blessings of 
Allah be upon him) as revealed to him by the Almighty Allah. Hadith Qudsi (or 
Sacred Hadith) are so named because, unlike the majority of Hadith which are 
Prophetic Hadith, their authority (Sanad) is traced back not to the Prophet but 
to the Almighty. </p>

        <p align="left">

Among the many definitions given by the early scholars to Sacred Hadith is that 
of as-Sayyid ash-Sharif al-Jurjani (died in 816 A.H.) in his lexicon At-Tarifat 
where he says: &quot;A Sacred Hadith is, as to the meaning, from Allah the Almighty; 
as to the wording, it is from the messenger of Allah (PBUH). It is that which 
Allah the Almighty has communicated to His Prophet through revelation or in 
dream, and he, peace be upon him, has communicated it in his own words. Thus 
Qur'an is superior to it because, besides being revealed, it is His wording.&quot; </p>

        <p><b>Hadith Qudsi 1:<br>
        </b>On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), 
        who said that the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: <br>
        <br>
        When Allah decreed the Creation He pledged Himself by writing in His 
        book which is laid down with Him: My mercy prevails over my wrath. <br>
        <br>
        It was related by Muslim (also by al-Bukhari, an-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah).
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Hadith Qudsi 2:<br>
        </b>On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), 
        who said that the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: Allah Almighty has 
        said: <br>
        The son of Adam denied Me and he had no right to do so. And he reviled 
        Me and he had no right to do so. As for his denying Me, it is his 
        saying: He will not remake me as He made me at first (1) - and the 
        initial creation [of him] is no easier for Me than remaking him. As for 
        his reviling Me, it is his saying: Allah has taken to Himself a son, 
        while I am the One, the Everlasting Refuge. I begot not nor was I 
        begotten, and there is none comparable to Me. <br>
        <br>
        (1) i.e., bring me back to life after death. <br>
        <br>
        It was related by al-Bukhari (also by an-Nasa'i). <br>
        <br>
        <b>Hadith Qudsi 3:<br>
        </b>On the authority of Zayd ibn Khalid al-Juhaniyy (may Allah be 
        pleased with him), who said: <br>
        The Messenger of Allah (may the blessings and peace of Allah be upon 
        him) led the morning prayer for us at al-Hudaybiyah following rainfall 
        during the night. When the Prophet (may the blessings and peace of Allah 
        be upon him) finished, he faced the people and said to them: Do you know 
        what your Lord has said? They said: Allah and his Messenger know best. 
        He said: This morning one of my servants became a believer in Me and one 
        a disbeliever. As for him who said: We have been given rain by virtue of 
        Allah and His mercy, that one is a believer in Me, a disbeliever in the 
        stars (2); and as for him who said: We have been given rain by 
        such-and-such a star, that one is a disbeliever in Me, a believer in the 
        stars.<br>
        <br>
        (2) The pre-Islamic Arabs believed that rain was brought about by the 
        movement of stars. This Hadith draws attention to the fact that whatever 
        be the direct cause of such natural phenomena as rain, it is Allah the 
        Almighty who is the Disposer of all things.<br>
        <br>
        It is related by al-Bukhari (also by Malik and an-Nasa'i). <br>
        <br>
        <b>Hadith Qudsi 4:<br>
        </b>On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), 
        who said that the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: Allah said: <br>
        Sons of Adam inveigh against [the vicissitudes of] Time, and I am Time, 
        in My hand is the night and the day (1). <br>
        <br>
        (1) As the Almighty is the Ordainer of all things, to inveigh aginst 
        misfortunes that are part of Time is tantamount to inveighing against 
        Him. <br>
        <br>
        It was related by al-Bukhari (also by Muslim). <br>
        <br>
        <b>Hadith Qudsi 5:<br>
        </b>On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), 
        who said that the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: Allah (glorified and 
        exalted be He) said:<br>
        I am so self-sufficient that I am in no need of having an associate. 
        Thus he who does an action for someone else's sake as well as Mine will 
        have that action renounced by Me to him whom he associated with Me.<br>
        <br>
        It was related by Muslim (also by Ibn Majah). <br>
        <br>
        <b>Hadith Qudsi 6:<br>
        </b>On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), 
        who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) say:<br>
        The first of people against whom judgment will be pronounced on the Day 
        of Resurrection will be a man who died a martyr. He will be brought and 
        Allah will make known to him His favours and he will recognize them. [ 
        The Almighty] will say: And what did you do about them? He will say: I 
        fought for you until I died a martyr. He will say: You have lied - you 
        did but fight that it might be said [of you]: He is courageous. And so 
        it was said. Then he will be ordered to be dragged along on his face 
        until he is cast into Hell-fire. [Another] will be a man who has studied 
        [religious] knowledge and has taught it and who used to recite the Quran. 
        He will be brought and Allah will make known to his His favours and he 
        will recognize them. [The Almighty] will say: And what did you do about 
        them? He will say: I studied [religious] knowledge and I taught it and I 
        recited the Quran for Your sake. He will say: You have lied - you did 
        but study [religious] knowledge that it might be said [of you]: He is 
        learned. And you recited the Quran that it might be said [of you]: He is 
        a reciter. And so it was said. Then he will be ordered to be dragged 
        along on his face until he is cast into Hell-fire. [Another] will be a 
        man whom Allah had made rich and to whom He had given all kinds of 
        wealth. He will be brought and Allah will make known to his His favours 
        and he will recognize them. [The Almighty] will say: And what did you do 
        about them? He will say: I left no path [untrodden] in which You like 
        money to be spent without spending in it for Your sake. He will say: You 
        have lied - you did but do so that it might be said [of you]: He is 
        open-handed. And so it was said. Then he will be ordered to be dragged 
        along on his face until he is cast into Hell-fire.<br>
        <br>
        It was related by Muslim (also by at-Tirmidhi and an-Nasa'i). <br>
        <br>
        <b>Hadith Qudsi 7:<br>
        </b>On the authority of Uqbah ibn Amir (may Allah be pleased with him), 
        who said: I heard the messenger of Allah (PBUH) say:<br>
        Your Lord delights at a shepherd who, on the peak of a mountain crag, 
        gives the call to prayer and prays. Then Allah (glorified and exalted be 
        He) say: Look at this servant of Mine, he gives the call to prayer and 
        performs the prayers; he is in awe of Me. I have forgiven My servant 
        [his sins] and have admitted him to Paradise.<br>
        <br>
        It was related by an-Nasa'i with a good chain of authorities. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Hadith Qudsi 8:<br>
        </b>On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) 
        from the Prophet (PBUH), who said: <br>
        A prayer performed by someone who has not recited the Essence of the 
        Quran (1) during it is deficient (and he repeated the word three times), 
        incomplete. Someone said to Abu Hurayrah: [Even though] we are behind 
        the imam? (2) He said: Recite it to yourself, for I have heard the 
        Prophet (may the blessings and peace of Allah be up on him) say: Allah 
        (mighty and sublime be He), had said: I have divided prayer between 
        Myself and My servant into two halves, and My servant shall have what he 
        has asked for. When the servant says: Al-hamdu lillahi rabbi l-alamin 
        (3), Allah (mighty and sublime be He) says: My servant has praised Me. 
        And when he says: Ar-rahmani r-rahim (4), Allah (mighty and sublime be 
        He) says: My servant has extolled Me, and when he says: Maliki yawmi 
        d-din (5), Allah says: My servant has glorified Me - and on one occasion 
        He said: My servant has submitted to My power. And when he says: Iyyaka 
        na budu wa iyyaka nasta in (6), He says: This is between Me and My 
        servant, and My servant shall have what he has asked for. And when he 
        says: Ihdina s-sirata l- mustaqim, siratal ladhina an amta alayhim 
        ghayril-maghdubi alayhim wa la d-dallin (7), He says: This is for My 
        servant, and My servant shall have what he has asked for.<br>
        <br>
        (1) Surat al-Fatihah, the first surah (chapter) of the Qur'an. <br>
        <br>
        (2) i.e. standing behind the imam (leader) listening to him reciting al-Fatihah.
        <br>
        <br>
        (3) &quot;Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds.&quot; <br>
        <br>
        (4) &quot;The Merciful, the Compassionate&quot;.<br>
        <br>
        (5) &quot;Master of the Day of Judgement&quot;.<br>
        <br>
        (6) &quot;It is You we worship and it is You we ask for help&quot;.<br>
        <br>
        (7) &quot;Guide us to the straight path, the path of those upon whom You have 
        bestowed favors, not of those against whom You are angry, nor of those 
        who are astray&quot;.<br>
        <br>
        It was related by Muslim (also by Malik, at-Tirmidhi, Abu-Dawud, an-Nasa'i 
        and Ibn Majah). <br>
        <br>
        <b>Hadith Qudsi 9:<br>
        </b>On the authority of Abu Harayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) 
        from the Prophet (PBUH), who said: Allah (mighty and sublime be He) 
        says: <br>
        The fist of his actions for which a servant of Allah will be held 
        accountable on the Day of Resurrection will be his prayers. If they are 
        in order, then he will have prospered and succeeded: and if they are 
        wanting, then he will have failed and lost. If there is something 
        defective in his obligatory prayers, the Lord (glorified and exalted be 
        He) will say: See if My servant has any supererogatory prayers with 
        which may be completed that which was defective in his obligatory 
        prayers. Then the rest of his actions will be judged in like fashion.
        <br>
        <br>
        It was related by at-Tirmidhi (also by Abu Dawud, an-Nasa'i, Ibn Majah 
        and Ahmad). <br>
        <br>
        <b>Hadith Qudsi 10:<br>
        </b>On the authority of Abu Harayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) 
        from the Prophet (PBUH), who said: Allah (mighty and sublime be He) 
        says: <br>
        Fasting is Mine and it I who give reward for it. [A man] gives up his 
        sexual passion, his food and his drink for my sake. Fasting is like a 
        shield, and he who fasts has two joys: a joy whin he breaks his fast and 
        a joy when he meets his Lord. The change in the breath of the mouth of 
        him who fasts is better in Allah's estimation than the smell of musk.
        <br>
        <br>
        It was related by al-Bukhari (also by Muslim, Malik, at-Tirmidhi, an-Nasa'i 
        and Ibn Majah). <br>
        <br>
        <b>Hadith Qudsi 11:<br>
        </b>On the authority of Abu Harayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) 
        from the Prophet (PBUH), who said: Allah (mighty and sublime be He) 
        said: <br>
        Spend (on charity), O son of Adam, and I shall spend on you. <br>
        <br>
        It was related by al-Bukhari (also by Muslim). <br>
        <br>
        <b>Hadith Qudsi 12:<br>
        </b>On the authority of Abu Mas'ud al-Ansari (may Allah be pleased with 
        him), who said that the Messenger of Allah (may the blessings and peace 
        of Allah be upon him) said: <br>
        A man from among those who were before you was called to account. 
        Nothing in the way of good was found for him except that he used to have 
        dealings with people and, being well-to-do, he would order his servants 
        to let off the man in straitened circumstances [from repaying his debt]. 
        He (the Prophet p.b.u.h) said that Allah said: We are worthier than you 
        of that (of being so generous). Let him off. <br>
        <br>
        It was related by Muslim (also by al-Bukhari and an-Nasa'i). <br>
        <br>
        <b>Hadith Qudsi 13:<br>
        </b>On the authority of Adiyy ibn Hatim (may Allah be pleased with him), 
        who said: <br>
        I was with the Messenger of Allah (may the blessings and peace of Allah 
        be upon him) and there came to him two men: one of them was complaining 
        of penury (being very poor), while the other was complaining of 
        brigandry (robbery). The Messenger of Allah (may the blessings and peace 
        of Allah be upon him) said: As for brigandry, it will be but a short 
        time before a caravan will [be able to] go out of Mecca without a guard. 
        As for penury, the Hour (Day of Judgement) will not arrive before one of 
        you takes his charity around without finding anyone to accept it from 
        him. Then (1) one of you will surely stand before Allah, there being no 
        screed between Him and him, nor an interpreter to translate for him. 
        Then He will say to him: Did I not bring you wealth? And he will say: 
        Yes. Then He will say: Did I not send to you a messenger? And he will 
        say: Yes. And he will look to his right and will see nothing but 
        Hell-fire, then he will look to his left and will see nothing but 
        Hell-fire, so let each of you protect himself against Hell-fire, be it 
        with even half a date - and if he finds it not, then with a kind word.
        <br>
        <br>
        (1) i.e. at the time of the Hour. It was related by al-Bukhari. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Hadith Qudsi 14:<br>
        </b>On the authority of Abu Harayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) 
        from the Prophet (PBUH), who said: <br>
        Allah (glorified and exalted be He) has supernumerary angels who rove 
        about seeking out gatherings in which Allah's name is being invoked: 
        they sit with them and fold their wings round each other, fillin that 
        which is between them and between the lowest heaven. When [the people in 
        the gathering] depart, [the angels] ascend and rise up to heaven. He 
        (the Prophet p.b.u.h.) said: Then Allah (mighty and sublime be He) asks 
        them - [though] He is most knowing about them: From where have you come? 
        And they say: We have come from some servants of Yours on Earth: they 
        were glorifying You (Subhana llah), exalting you (Allahu akbar), 
        witnessing that there is no god but You (La ilaha illa llah), praising 
        You (Al-Hamdu lillah), and asking [favours] of You. He says: And what do

        who said that the Prophet (PBUH) said: Allah the Almighty said: <br>
        I am as My servant thinks I am (1). I am with him when he makes mention 
        of Me. If he makes mention of Me to himself, I make mention of him to 
        Myself; and if he makes mention of Me in an assembly, I make mention of 
        him in an assemble better than it. And if he draws near to Me an arm's 
        length, I draw near to him a fathom's length. And if he comes to Me 
        walking, I go to him at speed. <br>
        <br>
        (1) Another possible rendering of the Arabic is: &quot;I am as My servant 
        expects Me to be&quot;. The meaning is that forgiveness and acceptance of 
        repentance by the Almighty is subject to His servant truly believing 
        that He is forgiving and merciful. However, not to accompany such belief 
        with right action would be to mock the Almighty. <br>

        shall forgive you. O My servants, you will not attain harming Me so as 
        to harm Me, and will not attain benefitting Me so as to benefit Me. O My

        says: Who is saying a prayer to Me that I may answer it? Who is asking 
        something of Me that I may give it him? Who is asking forgiveness of Me 
        that I may forgive him? <br>
        <br>
        It was related by al-Bukhari (also by Muslim, Malik, at-Tirmidhi and Abu 
        Dawud). <br>
        <br>
        In a version by Muslim the Hadith ends with the words: <br>
        <br>
        And thus He continues till [the light of] dawn shines. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Hadith Qudsi 36:<br>
        </b>On the authority of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) from the 
        Prophet (PBUH), who said: <br>
        The believers will gather together on the Day of Resurrection and will 
        say: Should we not ask [someone] to intercede for us with our Lord? So 
        they will come to Adam and will say: You are the Father of mankind; 
        Allah created you with His hand He made His angels bow down to you and 
        He taught you the names of everything, so intercede for us with you Lord 
        so that He may give us relief form this place where we are. And he will 
        say: I am not in a position [to do that] - and he will mention his 
        wrongdoing and will feel ashamed and will say: Go to Noah, for he is the 
        first messenger that Allah sent to the inhabitants of the earth. So they 
        will come to him and he will say: I am not in a position [to do that] - 
        and he will mention his having requested something of his Lord about 
        which he had no [proper] knowledge (Quran Chapter 11 Verses 45-46), and 
        he will feel ashamed and will say: Go to the Friend of the Merciful 
        (Abraham). So they will come to him and he will say: I am not in a 
        position [to do that]. Go to Moses, a servant to whom Allah talked and 
        to whom He gave the Torah. So they will come to him and he will say: I 
        am not in a position [to do that] - and he will mention the talking of a 
        life other that for a life (Quran Chapter 28 Verses 15-16), and he will 
        fell ashamed in the sight of his Lord and will say: Go to Jesus, Allah's 
        servant and messenger, Allah's word and spirit. So they will come to him 
        and he will say: I am not in a position [to do that]. Go to Muhammad 
        (may the blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), a servant to whom 
        Allah has forgiven all his wrongdoing, past and future. So they will 
        come to me and I shall set forth to ask permission to come to my Lord, 
        and permission will be given, and when I shall see my Lord I shall 
        prostrate myself. He will leave me thus for such time as it pleases Him, 
        and then it will be said [to me]: Raise your head. Ask and it will be 
        granted. Speak and it will be heard. Intercede and your intercession 
        will be accepted. So I shall raise my head and praise Him with a form of 
        praise that He will teach me. Then I shall intercede and HE will set me 
        a limit [as to the number of people], so I shall admit them into 
        Paradise. Then I shall return to Him, and when I shall see my Lord [I 
        shall bow down] as before. Then I shall intercede and He will set me a 
        limit [as to the number of people]. So I shall admit them into Paradise. 
        Then I shall return for a third time, then a fourth, and I shall say: 
        There remains in Hell-fire only those whom the Quran has confined and 
        who must be there for eternity. There shall come out of Hell-fire he who 
        has said: There is no god but Allah and who has in his heart goodness 
        weighing a barley-corn; then there shall come out of Hell-fire he who 
        has said: There is no god but Allah and who has in his heart goodness 
        weighing a grain of wheat; then there shall come out of Hell-fire he who 
        has said: There is no god but Allah and who has in his heart goodness 
        weighing an atom. <br>

        <b>Hadith Qudsi 37:<br>
        </b>On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), 
        who said that the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: Allah said: <br>
        I have prepared for My righteous servants what no eye has seen and no 
        ear has heard, not has it occurred to human heart. Thus recite if you 
        wish (1): And no soul knows what joy for them (the inhabitants of 
        Paradise) has been kept hidden (Quran Chapter 32 Verse 17). <br>
        <br>
        (1) The words &quot;Thus recite if you wish&quot; are those of Abu Harayrah. <br>

        who said that the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: <br>
        When Allah created Paradise and Hell-fire, He sent Gabriel to Paradise, 
        saying: Look at it and at what I have prepared therein for its 
        inhabitants. The Prophet (pbuh) said: So he came to it and looked at it 
        and at what Allah had prepared therein for its inhabitants. The Prophet 
        (pbuh) said: So he returned to Him and said: By your glory, no one hears 
        of it without entering it. So He ordered that it be encompassed by forms 
        of hardship, and He said: Return to it and look at what I have prepared 
        therein for its inhabitants. The Prophet (pbuh) said: So he returned to 
        it and found that it was encompassed by forms of hardship (1). Then he 
        returned to Him and said: By Your glory, I fear that no one will enter 
        it. He said: Go to Hell-fire and look at it and what I have prepared 
        therein for its inhabitants, and he fount that it was in layers, one 
        above the other. Then he returned to Him and said: By Your glory, no one 
        who hears of it will enter it. So He ordered that it be encompassed by 
        lusts. Then He said: Return to it. And he returned to it and said: By 
        Your glory, I am frightened that no one will escape from entering it.

        (1) The Arabic word used here is &quot;makarih&quot;, the literal meaning of which 
        is &quot;things that are disliked&quot;. In this context it refers to forms of 
        religious discipline that man usually finds onerous. <br>

        him), who said that the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: <br>
        Paradise and Hell-fire disputed together, and Hell-fire said: In me are 
        the mighty and the haughty. Paradise said: In me are the weak and the 
        poor. So Allah judged between them, [saying]: You are Paradise, My 
        mercy; through you I show mercy to those I wish. And you are Hell-fire, 
        My punishment; through you I punish those I wish, and it is incumbent 
        upon Me that each of you shall have its fill. <br>

        They will say: O our Lord, we present ourselves and are at Your 
        pleasure, and goodness rests in Your hands. Then He will say: Are you 
        contented? And they will say: And how should we not be contented, O 
        Lord, when You have given to us that which You have given to no one else 
        of Your creation? Then He will say: Would not like Me to give you 
        something better than that? And they will say: O Lord and what thing is 
        better than that? And He will say: I shall cause My favour to descend 
        upon you and thereafter shall never be displeased with you. <br>
