A lot of us might not be familiar or may not know what the term Electricity deregulation refers to. It is basically an attempt by the federal and state governments to lower down the cost of electricity to consumers by breaching up the industry to competition.
<BR>Deregulation of electricity allows nonutility companies to sell their power to the states, making up a freer market that encourages and boosts efficiency. Consumers in deregulated states can look around and shop for a seller who supports their need for electricity in their businesses, institutions, homes and farms. 
<BR>Following are a few reasons that might explain why an electricity deregulation is necessary in some states and why it is a good option in today�s time.
<BR>One of the options provided with deregulation is giving the customer the choice of paying a flat or changeable rate for their energy consumption. A lot of propane dealers have given this choice to their consumers in the past too. The propane customer would have the option of an agreement that would be set at a fixed rate per gallon for the whole year with no variation, or instead they could have a regular contract where the price per gallon would vary with the market.
<BR>With the facility to select your own power source, the consumers who wish to support green energy possibilities can do so with the help of their choice of a power source that uses wind and/ or solar energy.
<BR>Deregulation of electricity allows and encourages competition between already prevailing and those that are newly formed energy providers. This competition regularly helps keep prices lower than they are currently, under the existing regulated system.
<BR>Then, with deregulation also come a lot of fresh business opportunities, just as it happened in the case of the deregulation of telephone services. This way, smaller companies become eager to take on the giants of the industry. 
<BR>The service provided would still be done in the same way by the same people. Your billing would also still come through the same company, while only the costs applied would be subject to change now and then according to the rates that are updated and the requirements.
<BR>By doing so, an additional benefit achieved by deregulation is the education and awareness among the public on the subject of how the electric power they use is produced and distributed to all. This helps people get a better understanding of the whole scenario and how it all works.
<BR>Deregulation of electricity also has the capability of encouraging more and more investigation and study and also the development and improvement of renewable energy resources, by giving consumers more sustainable and convenient options for having easy and reachable access to these alternative sources.
<BR>Whenever utility costs are decreased, its benefits are always known to be far reaching. It not only puts more money in the pockets of the consumers, but it also lower downs the costs of doing business, which can in turn drastically reduce down prices.<br>
